        "All praise is for Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light. Yet the disbelievers set up equals to their Lord ˹in worship˺.",
        "He is the One Who created you from clay, then appointed a term ˹for your death˺ and another known only to Him ˹for your resurrection˺—yet you continue to doubt!",
        "He is the Only True God in the heavens and the earth. He knows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal, and knows whatever you do.",
        "Whenever a sign comes to them from their Lord, they turn away from it.",
        "They have indeed rejected the truth when it came to them, so they will soon face the consequences of their ridicule.",
        "Have they not seen how many ˹disbelieving˺ peoples We destroyed before them? We had made them more established in the land than you. We sent down abundant rain for them and made rivers flow at their feet. Then We destroyed them for their sins and replaced them with other peoples.",
        "Had We sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ a revelation in writing and they were to touch it with their own hands, the disbelievers would still have said, “This is nothing but pure magic!”",
        "They say, “Why has no ˹visible˺ angel come with him?” Had We sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been settled ˹at once˺, and they would have never been given more time ˹to repent˺.",
        "And if We had sent an angel, We would have certainly made it ˹assume the form of˺ a man—leaving them more confused than they already are.",
        "˹Other˺ messengers had already been ridiculed before you ˹O Prophet˺, but those who mocked them were overtaken by what they used to ridicule.",
        "Say, “Travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers.”",
        "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “To whom belongs everything in the heavens and the earth?” Say, “To Allah!” He has taken upon Himself to be Merciful. He will certainly gather ˹all of˺ you together for the Day of Judgment—about which there is no doubt. But those who have ruined themselves will never believe.",
        "To Him belongs whatever exists in the day and night. And He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Will I take any guardian other than Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who provides for all and is not in need of provision?” Say, “I have been commanded to be the first to submit and not be one of the polytheists.”",
        "Say, “I truly fear—if I were to disobey my Lord—the torment of a tremendous Day.”",
        "Whoever is spared the torment of that Day will have certainly been shown Allah’s mercy. And that is the absolute triumph.",
        "If Allah touches you with harm, none can undo it except Him. And if He touches you with a blessing, He is Most Capable of everything.",
        "He reigns supreme over His creation. And He is the All-Wise, All-Aware.",
        "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Who is the best witness?” Say, “Allah is! He is a Witness between me and you. And this Quran has been revealed to me so that, with it, I may warn you and whoever it reaches. Do you ˹pagans˺ testify that there are other gods besides Allah?” ˹Then˺ say, “I will never testify ˹to this˺!” ˹And˺ say, “There is only One God. And I totally reject whatever ˹idols˺ you associate with Him.”",
        "Those to whom We gave the Scripture recognize him ˹to be a true prophet˺ as they recognize their own children. Those who have ruined themselves will never believe.",
        "Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah or deny His signs? Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.",
        "˹Consider˺ the Day We will gather them all together then ask those who associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺, “Where are those gods you used to claim?”",
        "Their only argument will be: “By Allah, our Lord! We were never polytheists.”",
        "See how they will lie about themselves and how those ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them!",
        "There are some of them who ˹pretend to˺ listen to your recitation ˹of the Quran˺, but We have cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend it—and deafness in their ears. Even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. The disbelievers would ˹even˺ come to argue with you, saying, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but ancient fables!”",
        "They turn others away from the Prophet and distance themselves as well. They ruin none but themselves, yet they fail to perceive it.",
        "If only you could see when they will be detained before the Fire! They will cry, “Oh! If only we could be sent back, we would never deny the signs of our Lord and we would ˹surely˺ be of the believers.”",
        "But no! ˹They only say this˺ because the truth they used to hide will become all too clear to them. Even if they were to be sent back, they would certainly revert to what they were forbidden. Indeed they are liars!",
        "They insisted, “There is nothing beyond this worldly life and we will never be resurrected.”",
        "But if only you could see when they will be detained before their Lord! He will ask ˹them˺, “Is this ˹Hereafter˺ not the truth?” They will cry, “Absolutely, by our Lord!” He will say, “Then taste the punishment for your disbelief.”",
        "Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting with Allah until the Hour takes them by surprise, then they will cry, “Woe to us for having ignored this!” They will bear ˹the burden of˺ their sins on their backs. Evil indeed is their burden!",
        "This worldly life is no more than play and amusement, but far better is the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?",
        "We certainly know that what they say grieves you ˹O Prophet˺. It is not your honesty they question—it is Allah’s signs that the wrongdoers deny.",
        "Indeed, messengers before you were rejected but patiently endured rejection and persecution until Our help came to them. And Allah’s promise ˹to help˺ is never broken. And you have already received some of the narratives of these messengers.",
        "If you find their denial unbearable, then build—if you can—a tunnel through the earth or stairs to the sky to bring them a ˹more compelling˺ sign. Had Allah so willed, He could have guided them all. So do not be one of those ignorant ˹of this fact˺.",
        "Only the attentive will respond ˹to your call˺. As for the dead, Allah will raise them up, then to Him they will ˹all˺ be returned.",
        "They ask, “Why has no ˹other˺ sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah certainly has the power to send down a sign”—though most of them do not know.",
        "All living beings roaming the earth and winged birds soaring in the sky are communities like yourselves. We have left nothing out of the Record. Then to their Lord they will be gathered all together.",
        "Those who deny Our signs are ˹wilfully˺ deaf and dumb—lost in darkness. Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills to the Straight Way.",
        "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Imagine if you were overwhelmed by Allah’s torment or the Hour—would you call upon any other than Allah ˹for help˺? ˹Answer me˺ if your claims are true!",
        "No! He is the only One you would call. And if He willed, He could remove the affliction that made you invoke Him. Only then will you forget whatever you associate with Him ˹in worship˺.”",
        "Indeed, We have sent messengers before you ˹O Prophet˺ to other people who We put through suffering and adversity ˹for their denial˺, so perhaps they would be humbled.",
        "Why did they not humble themselves when We made them suffer? Instead, their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them.",
        "When they became oblivious to warnings, We showered them with everything they desired. But just as they became prideful of what they were given, We seized them by surprise, then they instantly fell into despair!",
        "So the wrongdoers were utterly uprooted. And all praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds.",
        "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Imagine if Allah were to take away your hearing or sight, or seal your hearts—who else other than Allah could restore it?” See ˹O Prophet˺ how We vary the signs, yet they still turn away.",
        "Ask, “Imagine if Allah’s punishment were to overwhelm you with or without warning—who would be destroyed other than the wrongdoers?”",
        "We have sent messengers only as deliverers of good news and as warners. Whoever believes and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
        "But those who deny Our signs will be afflicted with punishment for their rebelliousness.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not say to you that I possess Allah’s treasuries or know the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.” Say, “Are those blind ˹to the truth˺ equal to those who can see? Will you not then reflect?”",
        "Warn with this ˹Quran˺ those who are awed by the prospect of being gathered before their Lord—when they will have no protector or intercessor besides Him—so perhaps they will be mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "˹O Prophet!˺ Do not dismiss those ˹poor believers˺ who invoke their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. You are not accountable for them whatsoever, nor are they accountable for you. So do not dismiss them, or you will be one of the wrongdoers.",
        "In this way We have tested some by means of others, so those ˹disbelievers˺ may say, “Has Allah favoured these ˹poor believers˺ out of all of us?” Does Allah not best recognize the grateful?",
        "When the believers in Our revelations come to you, say, “Peace be upon you! Your Lord has taken upon Himself to be Merciful. Whoever among you commits evil ignorantly ˹or recklessly˺ then repents afterwards and mends their ways, then Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",
        "This is how We make Our signs clear, so the way of the wicked may become distinct.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides Allah.” Say, “I will not follow your desires, for I then would certainly be astray and not one of those ˹rightly˺ guided.”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, I stand on a clear proof from my Lord—yet you have denied it. That ˹torment˺ you seek to hasten is not within my power. It is only Allah Who decides ˹its time˺. He declares the truth. And He is the Best of Judges.”",
        "Say ˹also˺, “If what you seek to hasten were within my power, the matter between us would have already been settled. But Allah knows the wrongdoers best.”",
        "With Him are the keys of the unseen—no one knows them except Him. And He knows what is in the land and sea. Not even a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth or anything—green or dry—but is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record.",
        "He is the One Who calls back your souls by night and knows what you do by day, then revives you daily to complete your appointed term. To Him is your ˹ultimate˺ return, then He will inform you of what you used to do.",
        "He reigns supreme over all of His creation, and sends recording-angels, watching over you. When death comes to any of you, Our angels take their soul, never neglecting this duty.",
        "Then they are ˹all˺ returned to Allah—their True Master. Judgment is His ˹alone˺. And He is the Swiftest Reckoner.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who rescues you from the darkest times on land and at sea? He ˹alone˺ you call upon with humility, openly and secretly: “If You rescue us from this, we will be ever grateful.”",
        "Say, “˹Only˺ Allah rescues you from this and any other distress, yet you associate others with Him ˹in worship˺.”",
        "Say, “He ˹alone˺ has the power to unleash upon you a torment from above or below you or split you into ˹conflicting˺ factions and make you taste the violence of one another.” See how We vary the signs, so perhaps they will comprehend.",
        "Still your people ˹O Prophet˺ have rejected this ˹Quran˺, although it is the truth. Say, “I am not a keeper over you.”",
        "Every ˹destined˺ matter has a ˹set˺ time to transpire. And you will soon come to know.",
        "And when you come across those who ridicule Our revelations, do not sit with them unless they engage in a different topic. Should Satan make you forget, then once you remember, do not ˹continue to˺ sit with the wrongdoing people.",
        "Those mindful ˹of Allah˺ will not be accountable for those ˹who ridicule it˺ whatsoever—their duty is to advise, so perhaps the ridiculers will abstain.",
        "And leave those who take this faith ˹of Islam˺ as mere play and amusement and are deluded by ˹their˺ worldly life. Yet remind them by this ˹Quran˺, so no one should be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have no protector or intercessor other than Allah. Even if they were to offer every ˹possible˺ ransom, none will be accepted from them. Those are the ones who will be ruined for their misdeeds. They will have a boiling drink and painful punishment for their disbelief.",
        "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Should we invoke, other than Allah, those ˹idols˺ which cannot benefit or harm us, and turn back to disbelief after Allah has guided us? ˹If we do so, we will be˺ like those disoriented by devils in the wilderness, while their companions call them to guidance, ˹saying˺, ‘Come to us!’ Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah’s guidance is the ˹only˺ true guidance. And we are commanded to submit to the Lord of all worlds",
        "establish prayer, and be mindful of Him. To Him you will all be gathered together.",
        "He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in truth. On the Day ˹of Judgment˺ He will say, ‘Be!’ And there will be! His command is truth. All authority is His ˹alone˺ on the Day the Trumpet will be blown. He is the Knower of all—seen or unseen. And He is the All-Wise, All-Aware.”",
        "And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said to his father, Ȃzar, “Do you take idols as gods? It is clear to me that you and your people are entirely misguided.”",
        "We also showed Abraham the wonders of the heavens and the earth, so he would be sure in faith.",
        "When the night grew dark upon him, he saw a star and said, “This is my Lord!” But when it set, he said, “I do not love things that set.”",
        "Then when he saw the moon rising, he said, “This one is my Lord!” But when it disappeared, he said, “If my Lord does not guide me, I will certainly be one of the misguided people.”",
        "Then when he saw the sun shining, he said, “This must be my Lord—it is the greatest!” But again when it set, he declared, “O my people! I totally reject whatever you associate ˹with Allah in worship˺.",
        "I have turned my face towards the One Who has originated the heavens and the earth—being upright—and I am not one of the polytheists.”",
        "And his people argued with him. He responded, “Are you arguing with me about Allah, while He has guided me? I am not afraid of whatever ˹idols˺ you associate with Him—˹none can harm me,˺ unless my Lord so wills. My Lord encompasses everything in ˹His˺ knowledge. Will you not be mindful?",
        "And how should I fear your associate-gods, while you have no fear in associating ˹others˺ with Allah—a practice He has never authorized? Which side has more right to security? ˹Tell me˺ if you really know!”",
        "It is ˹only˺ those who are faithful and do not tarnish their faith with falsehood who are guaranteed security and are ˹rightly˺ guided.",
        "This was the argument We gave Abraham against his people. We elevate in rank whoever We please. Surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.",
        "And We blessed him with Isaac and Jacob. We guided them all as We previously guided Noah and those among his descendants: David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. This is how We reward the good-doers.",
        "Likewise, ˹We guided˺ Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias, who were all of the righteous.",
        "˹We also guided˺ Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot, favouring each over other people ˹of their time˺.",
        "And ˹We favoured˺ some of their forefathers, their descendants, and their brothers. We chose them and guided them to the Straight Path.",
        "This is Allah’s guidance with which He guides whoever He wills of His servants. Had they associated others with Him ˹in worship˺, their ˹good˺ deeds would have been wasted.",
        "Those were the ones to whom We gave the Scripture, wisdom, and prophethood. But if these ˹pagans˺ disbelieve in this ˹message˺, then We have already entrusted it to a people who will never disbelieve in it.",
        "These ˹prophets˺ were ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah, so follow their guidance. Say, “I ask no reward of you for this ˹Quran˺—it is a reminder to the whole world.”",
        "And they have not shown Allah His proper reverence when they said, “Allah has revealed nothing to any human being.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who then revealed the Book brought forth by Moses as a light and guidance for people, which you split into separate sheets—revealing some and hiding much? You have been taught ˹through this Quran˺ what neither you nor your forefathers knew.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah ˹revealed it˺!” Then leave them to amuse themselves with falsehood.",
        "This is a blessed Book which We have revealed—confirming what came before it—so you may warn the Mother of Cities and everyone around it. Those who believe in the Hereafter ˹truly˺ believe in it and guard their prayers.",
        "Who does more wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah or claims, “I have received revelations!”—although nothing was revealed to them—or the one who says, “I can reveal the like of Allah’s revelations!”? If you ˹O Prophet˺ could only see the wrongdoers in the throes of death while the angels are stretching out their hands ˹saying˺, “Give up your souls! Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for telling lies about Allah and for being arrogant towards His revelations!”",
        "˹Today˺ you have come back to Us all alone as We created you the first time—leaving behind everything We have provided you with. We do not see your intercessors with you—those you claimed were Allah’s partners ˹in worship˺. All your ties have been broken and all your claims have let you down.”",
        "Indeed, Allah is the One Who causes seeds and fruit stones to sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. That is Allah! How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺?",
        "He causes the dawn to break, and has made the night for rest and ˹made˺ the sun and the moon ˹to travel˺ with precision. That is the design of the Almighty, All-Knowing.",
        "And He is the One Who has made the stars as your guide through the darkness of land and sea. We have already made the signs clear for people who know.",
        "And He is the One Who originated you all from a single soul, then assigned you a place to live and another to ˹be laid to˺ rest. We have already made the signs clear for people who comprehend.",
        "And He is the One Who sends down rain from the sky—causing all kinds of plants to grow—producing green stalks from which We bring forth clustered grain. And from palm trees come clusters of dates hanging within reach. ˹There are˺ also gardens of grapevines, olives, and pomegranates, similar ˹in shape˺ but dissimilar ˹in taste˺. Look at their fruit as it yields and ripens! Indeed, in these are signs for people who believe.",
        "Yet they associate the jinn with Allah ˹in worship˺, even though He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters out of ignorance. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they claim!",
        "˹He is˺ the Originator of the heavens and earth. How could He have children when He has no mate? He created all things and has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of everything.",
        "That is Allah—your Lord! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. ˹He is˺ the Creator of all things, so worship Him ˹alone˺. And He is the Maintainer of everything.",
        "No vision can encompass Him, but He encompasses all vision. For He is the Most Subtle, All-Aware.",
        "Indeed, there have come to you insights from your Lord. So whoever chooses to see, it is for their own good. But whoever chooses to be blind, it is to their own loss. And I am not a keeper over you.",
        "And so We vary our signs to the extent that they will say, “You have studied ˹previous scriptures˺,” and We make this ˹Quran˺ clear for people who know.",
        "˹O Prophet!˺ Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord—there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—and turn away from the polytheists.",
        "Had Allah willed, they would not have been polytheists. We have not appointed you as their keeper, nor are you their maintainer.",
        "˹O believers!˺ Do not insult what they invoke besides Allah or they will insult Allah spitefully out of ignorance. This is how We have made each people’s deeds appealing to them. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they used to do.",
        "They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a sign were to come to them, they would certainly believe in it. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Signs are only with Allah.” What will make you ˹believers˺ realize that even if a sign were to come to them, they still would not believe?",
        "We turn their hearts and eyes away ˹from the truth˺ as they refused to believe at first, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance.",
        "Even if We had sent them the angels, made the dead speak to them, and assembled before their own eyes every sign ˹they demanded˺, they still would not have believed—unless Allah so willed. But most of them are ignorant ˹of this˺.",
        "And so We have made for every prophet enemies—devilish humans and jinn—whispering to one another with elegant words of deception. Had it been your Lord’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their deceit",
        "so that the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter may be receptive to it, be pleased with it, and be persistent in their evil pursuits.",
        "˹Say, O  Prophet,˺ “Should I seek a judge other than Allah while He is the One Who has revealed for you the Book ˹with the truth˺ perfectly explained?” Those who were given the Scripture know that it has been revealed ˹to you˺ from your Lord in truth. So do not be one of those who doubt.",
        "The Word of your Lord has been perfected in truth and justice. None can change His Words. And He is the All-Hearing, All- Knowing.",
        "˹O Prophet!˺ If you were to obey most of those on earth, they would lead you away from Allah’s Way. They follow nothing but assumptions and do nothing but lie.",
        "Indeed, your Lord knows best who has strayed from His Way and who is ˹rightly˺ guided.",
        "So eat only of what is slaughtered in Allah’s Name if you truly believe in His revelations.",
        "Why should you not eat of what is slaughtered in Allah’s Name when He has already explained to you what He has forbidden to you—except when compelled by necessity? Many ˹deviants˺ certainly mislead others by their whims out of ignorance. Surely your Lord knows the transgressors best.",
        "Shun all sin—open and secret. Indeed, those who commit sin will be punished for what they earn.",
        "Do not eat of what is not slaughtered in Allah’s Name. For that would certainly be ˹an act of˺ disobedience. Surely the devils whisper to their ˹human˺ associates to argue with you. If you were to obey them, then you ˹too˺ would be polytheists.",
        "Can those who had been dead, to whom We gave life and a light with which they can walk among people, be compared to those in complete darkness from which they can never emerge? That is how the misdeeds of the disbelievers have been made appealing to them.",
        "And so We have placed in every society the most wicked to conspire in it. Yet they plot only against themselves, but they fail to perceive it.",
        "Whenever a sign comes to them, they say, “We will never believe until we receive what Allah’s messengers received.” Allah knows best where to place His message. The wicked will soon be overwhelmed by humiliation from Allah and a severe punishment for their evil plots.",
        "Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam. But whoever He wills to leave astray, He makes their chest tight and constricted as if they were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah dooms those who disbelieve.",
        "That is your Lord’s Path—perfectly straight. We have already made the signs clear to those who are mindful.",
        "They will have the Home of Peace with their Lord, Who will be their Guardian because of what they used to do.",
        "˹Consider˺ the Day He will gather them ˹all˺ together and say, “O assembly of jinn! You misled humans in great numbers.” And their human associates will say, “Our Lord! We benefited from each other’s company, but now we have reached the term which You appointed for us.” ˹Then˺ He will say, “The Fire is your home, yours to stay in forever, except whoever Allah wills to spare.” Surely your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.",
        "This is how We make the wrongdoers ˹destructive˺ allies of one another because of their misdeeds.",
        "˹Allah will ask,˺ “O assembly of jinn and humans! Did messengers not come from among you, proclaiming My revelations and warning you of the coming of this Day of yours?” They will say, “We confess against ourselves!” For they have been deluded by ˹their˺ worldly life. And they will testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.",
        "This ˹sending of the messengers˺ is because your Lord would never destroy a society for their wrongdoing while its people are unaware ˹of the truth˺.",
        "They will each be assigned ranks according to their deeds. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do.",
        "Your Lord is the Self-Sufficient, Full of Mercy. If He wills, He can do away with you and replace you with whoever He wills, just as He produced you from the offspring of other people.",
        "Indeed, what you have been promised will certainly come to pass. And you will have no escape.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O my people! Persist in your ways, for I ˹too˺ will persist in mine. You will soon know who will fare best in the end. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.”",
        "The pagans set aside for Allah a share of the crops and cattle He created, saying, “This ˹portion˺ is for Allah,” so they claim, “and this ˹one˺ for our associate-gods.” Yet the portion of their associate-gods is not shared with Allah while Allah’s portion is shared with their associate-gods. What unfair judgment!",
        "Likewise, the pagans’ evil associates have made it appealing to them to kill their own children—only leading to their destruction as well as confusion in their faith. Had it been Allah’s Will, they would not have done such a thing. So leave them and their falsehood.",
        "They say, “These cattle and crops are reserved—none may eat them except those we permit,” so they claim. Some other cattle are exempted from labour and others are not slaughtered in Allah’s Name—falsely attributing lies to Him. He will repay them for their lies.",
        "They ˹also˺ say, “The offspring of this cattle is reserved for our males and forbidden to our females; but if it is stillborn, they may all share it.” He will repay them for their falsehood. Surely He is All-Wise, All-Knowing.",
        "Lost indeed are those who have murdered their own children foolishly out of ignorance and have forbidden what Allah has provided for them—falsely attributing lies to Allah. They have certainly strayed and are not ˹rightly˺ guided.",
        "He is the One Who produces gardens—both cultivated and wild—and palm trees, crops of different flavours, olives, and pomegranates—similar ˹in shape˺, but dissimilar ˹in taste˺. Eat of the fruit they bear and pay the dues at harvest, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the wasteful.",
        "Some cattle are fit for labour, others are too small. Eat of what Allah has provided for you and do not follow Satan’s footsteps. Certainly, he is your sworn enemy.",
        "˹Allah has created˺ four pairs: a pair of sheep and a pair of goats—ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Has He forbidden ˹to you˺ the two males or the two females or what is in the wombs of the two females? Tell me with knowledge, if what you say is true.”—",
        "and a pair of camels and a pair of oxen. Ask ˹them˺, “Has He forbidden ˹to you˺ the two males or the two females or what is in the wombs of the two females? Or were you present when Allah gave you this commandment?” Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah to mislead others without ˹any˺ knowledge? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to eat except carrion, running blood, swine—which is impure—or a sinful offering in the name of any other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need—then surely your Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”",
        "For those who are Jewish, We forbade every animal with undivided hoofs and the fat of oxen and sheep except what is joined to their backs or intestines or mixed with bone. In this way We rewarded them for their violations. And We are certainly truthful.",
        "But if they deny you ˹O Prophet˺, say, “Your Lord is infinite in mercy, yet His punishment will not be averted from the wicked people.”",
        "The polytheists will argue, “Had it been Allah’s Will, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated others with Him ˹in worship˺ or made anything unlawful.” Likewise, those before them rejected the truth until they tasted Our punishment. Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? Surely you follow nothing but ˹false˺ assumptions and you do nothing but lie.”",
        "Say, “Allah has the most conclusive argument. Had it been His Will, He would have easily imposed guidance upon all of you.”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Bring your witnesses who can testify that Allah has forbidden this.” If they ˹falsely˺ testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the desires of those who deny Our proofs, disbelieve in the Hereafter, and set up equals with their Lord.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Come! Let me recite to you what your Lord has forbidden to you: do not associate others with Him ˹in worship˺. ˹Do not fail to˺ honour your parents. Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for you and for them. Do not come near indecencies, openly or secretly. Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will understand.",
        "And do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless intending to enhance it—until they attain maturity. Give full measure and weigh with justice. We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. Whenever you speak, maintain justice—even regarding a close relative. And fulfil your covenant with Allah. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be mindful.",
        "Indeed, that is My Path—perfectly straight. So follow it and do not follow other ways, for they will lead you away from His Way. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be conscious ˹of Allah˺.”",
        "Additionally, We gave Moses the Scripture, completing the favour upon those who do good, detailing everything, and as a guide and a mercy, so perhaps they would be certain of the meeting with their Lord.",
        "This is a blessed Book We have revealed. So follow it and be mindful ˹of Allah˺, so you may be shown mercy.",
        "You ˹pagans˺ can no longer say, “Scriptures were only revealed to two groups before us and we were unaware of their teachings.”",
        "Nor can you say, “If only the Scriptures had been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.” Now there has come to you from your Lord a clear proof—a guide and mercy. Who then does more wrong than those who deny Allah’s revelations and turn away from them? We will reward those who turn away from Our revelations with a dreadful punishment for turning away.",
        "Are they awaiting the coming of the angels, or your Lord ˹Himself˺, or some of your Lord’s ˹major˺ signs? On the Day your Lord’s signs arrive, belief will not benefit those who did not believe earlier or those who did no good through their faith. Say, “Keep waiting! We too are waiting.”",
        "Indeed, you ˹O Prophet˺ are not responsible whatsoever for those who have divided their faith and split into sects. Their judgment rests only with Allah. And He will inform them of what they used to do.",
        "Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded tenfold. But whoever comes with a bad deed will be punished for only one. None will be wronged.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Surely my Lord has guided me to the Straight Path, a perfect way, the faith of Abraham, the upright, who was not one of the polytheists.”",
        "Say, “Surely my prayer, my worship, my life, and my death are all for Allah—Lord of all worlds.",
        "He has no partner. So I am commanded, and so I am the first to submit.”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Should I seek a lord other than Allah while He is the Lord of everything?” No one will reap except what they sow. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of your differences.",
        "He is the One Who has placed you as successors on earth and elevated some of you in rank over others, so He may test you with what He has given you. Surely your Lord is swift in punishment, but He is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

        "তারাই সাড়া দেয় যারা শুনে। আর মৃতদেরকে আল্লাহ পুনরায় জীবিত করবেন। তারপর তার দিকেই প্রত্যাবর্তিত হবে।",
        "আর তারা বলে, ‘কেন তার উপর তার রবের পক্ষ থেকে কোন নিদর্শন নাযিল করা হয়নি’? বল, ‘নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ যে কোন নিদর্শন নাযিল করতে সক্ষম। কিন্তু তাদের অধিকাংশ জানে না’।",
        "আর যমীনে বিচরণকারী প্রতিটি প্রাণী এবং দু’ডানা দিয়ে উড়ে এমন প্রতিটি পাখি, তোমাদের মত এক একটি উম্মত। আমি কিতাবে কোন ত্রুটি করিনি। অতঃপর তাদেরকে তাদের রবের কাছে সমবেত করা হবে।",
        "আর যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহকে অস্বীকার করেছে, তারা বোবা ও বধির, অন্ধকারে রয়েছে। আল্লাহ যাকে চান, তাকে পথভ্রষ্ট করেন এবং যাকে চান তাকে সরল পথে অটল রাখেন।",
        "বল, ‘তোমরা কি বিবেচনা কর, যদি তোমাদের কাছে আল্লাহর আযাব এসে যায় অথবা কিয়ামত আগমন করে, তবে কি তোমরা আল্লাহ ছাড়া অন্য কাউকে ডাকবে, যদি তোমরা সত্যবাদী হও?",
        "বরং তাকেই তোমরা ডাকবে। অতঃপর যদি তিনি চান, যে জন্য তাকে ডাকছ, তা তিনি দূর করে দেবেন। আর তোমরা যা শরীক কর, তা তোমরা ভুলে যাবে।",
        "আর আমি তোমাদের পূর্বেকার জাতিসমূহের কাছে বহু রাসূল পাঠিয়েছি, আমি তাদের প্রতি ক্ষুধা, দারিদ্রতা ও রোগ ব্যাধি চাপিয়ে দিয়েছি, যেন তারা নম্রতা প্রকাশ করে আমার সামনে নতি স্বীকার করে।",
        "সুতরাং তারা কেন বিনীত হয়নি, যখন আমার আযাব তাদের কাছে আসল? কিন্তু তাদের হৃদয় নিষ্ঠুর হয়ে গিয়েছে। আর তারা যা করত, শয়তান তাদের জন্য তা শোভিত করেছে।",
        "অতঃপর তাদেরকে যে উপদেশ দেয়া হয়েছিল, তারা যখন তা ভুলে গেল, আমি তাদের উপর সব কিছুর দরজা খুলে দিলাম। অবশেষে যখন তাদেরকে যা প্রদান করা হয়েছিল তার কারণে তারা উৎফুল্ল হল, আমি হঠাৎ তাদেরকে পাকড়াও করলাম। ফলে তখন তারা হতাশ হয়ে গেল।",
        "অতএব যালিম সম্প্রদায়ের মূল কেটে ফেলা হল। আর সকল প্রশংসা রাববুল আলামীন আল্লাহর জন্য।",

        "বল, ‘তোমরা আমাকে জানাও, যদি আল্লাহর আযাব হঠাৎ কিংবা প্রকাশ্যে তোমাদের কাছে এসে যায়, যালিম কওম ছাড়া অন্য কাউকে ধ্বংস করা হবে কি?’",
        "আর আমি রাসূলদেরকে কেবল সুসংবাদদাতা ও সতর্ককারী হিসেবে প্রেরণ করি। অতএব যারা ঈমান এনেছে ও শুধরে নিয়েছে, তাদের উপর কোন ভয় নেই এবং তারা চি‎‎ন্তিত হবে না।",
        "আর যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহকে অস্বীকার করেছে তাদেরকে স্পর্শ করবে আযাব, এ কারণে যে, তারা নাফরমানী করত।",
        "বল, ‘তোমাদেরকে আমি বলি না, আমার কাছে আল্লাহর ভান্ডারসমূহ রয়েছে এবং আমি গায়েব জানি না এবং তোমাদেরকে বলি না, নিশ্চয় আমি ফেরেশতা। আমি কেবল তাই অনুসরণ করি যা আমার কাছে ওহী প্রেরণ করা হয়’। বল, ‘অন্ধ আর চক্ষুষ্মান কি সমান হতে পারে? অতএব তোমরা কি চিন্তা করবে না?’",
        "আর এ দ্বারা তুমি তাদেরকে সতর্ক কর, যারা ভয় করে যে, তাদেরকে তাদের রবের দিকে সমবেত করা হবে, (এ অবস্থায় যে) তিনি ছাড়া তাদের জন্য থাকবে না কোন সাহায্যকারী আর না সুপারিশকারী। হয়ত তারা তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করবে।",
        "আর তুমি তাড়িয়ে দিয়ো না তাদেরকে, যারা নিজ রবকে সকাল সন্ধ্যায় ডাকে, তারা তার সন্তুষ্টি চায়। তাদের কোন হিসাব তোমার উপর নেই এবং তোমার কোন হিসাব তাদের উপর নেই, ফলে তুমি তাদেরকে তাড়িয়ে দিবে এবং তুমি যালিমদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হবে।",
        "আর এভাবেই আমি এককে অন্যের দ্বারা পরীক্ষা করেছি, যাতে তারা বলে, ‘এরাই কি, আমাদের মধ্য থেকে যাদের উপর আল্লাহ অনুগ্রহ করেছেন? আল্লাহ কি কৃতজ্ঞদের ব্যাপারে পূর্ণ জ্ঞাত নয়?",
        "আর যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহের উপর ঈমান আনে, তারা যখন তোমার কাছে আসে, তখন তুমি বল, ‘তোমাদের উপর সালাম’। তোমাদের রব তাঁর নিজের উপর লিখে নিয়েছেন দয়া, নিশ্চয় যে তোমাদের মধ্য থেকে না জেনে খারাপ কাজ করে তারপর তাওবা করে এবং শুধরে নেয়, তবে তিনি ক্ষমাশীল, পরম দয়ালু।",
        "আর এভাবেই আমি আয়াতসমূহ বিস্তারিত বর্ণনা করি। আর যাতে অপরাধীদের পথ স্পষ্ট হয়ে যায়।",
        "বল, ‘নিশ্চয় আমাকে নিষেধ করা হয়েছে তাদের ইবাদাত করতে, যাদেরকে তোমরা ডাক আল্লাহ ছাড়া। বল, ‘আমি তোমাদের প্রবৃত্তির অনুসরণ করি না, (যদি করি) নিশ্চয় তখন পথভ্রষ্ট হব এবং আমি হিদায়াতপ্রাপ্তদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হব না।",
        "বল, ‘নিশ্চয় আমি আমার রবের পক্ষ থেকে স্পষ্ট প্রমাণের উপর রয়েছি আর তোমরা তা অস্বীকার করছ। তোমরা যা নিয়ে তাড়াহুড়া করছ তা আমার কাছে নেই। হুকুম কেবল আল্লাহর কাছে। তিনি সত্য বর্ণনা করেন এবং তিনি সর্বোত্তম ফয়সালাকারী’।",

        "আর তাঁর কাছে রয়েছে গায়েবের চাবিসমূহ, তিনি ছাড়া এ বিষয়ে কেউ জানে না এবং তিনি অবগত রয়েছেন স্থলে ও সমুদ্রে যা কিছু আছে। আর কোন পাতা ঝরে না, কিন্তু তিনি তা জানেন এবং যমীনের অন্ধকারে কোন দানা পড়ে না, না কোন ভেজা এবং না কোন শুষ্ক কিছু; কিন্তু রয়েছে সুস্পষ্ট কিতাবে।",
        "আর তিনিই রাতে তোমাদেরকে মৃত্যু দেন এবং দিনে তোমরা যা কামাই কর তিনি তা জানেন। তারপর তিনি তোমাদেরকে দিনে পুনরায় জাগিয়ে তুলেন, যাতে নির্দিষ্ট মেয়াদ পূর্ণ করা হয়। তারপর তাঁর দিকেই তোমাদের প্রত্যাবর্তন। তারপর তোমরা যা করতে তিনি তোমাদেরকে সে বিষয়ে অবহিত করবেন।",
        "আর তিনিই নিজ বান্দাদের উপর ক্ষমতাবান এবং তোমাদের উপর প্রেরণ করেন হিফাযতকারীদেরকে। অবশেষে যখন তোমাদের কারো কাছে মৃত্যু আসে, আমার প্রেরিত দূতগণ তার মৃত্যু ঘটায়। আর তারা কোন ত্রুটি করে না।",
        "তারপর তাদেরকে প্রত্যাবর্তিত করা হয় তাদের সত্য মাওলা আল্লাহর কাছে। সাবধান! হুকুম প্রাদানের ক্ষমতা তাঁরই। আর তিনি হচ্ছেন খুব দ্রুত হিসাবকারী।",
        "বল, ‘কে তোমাদেরকে নাজাত দেন স্থল ও সমুদ্রের যাবতীয় অন্ধকার থেকে? তোমরা তাকে ডাক অনুনয় বিনয় করে ও চুপিসারে যে, যদি তিনি আমাদেরকে এ থেকে নাজাত দেন, আমরা অবশ্যই কৃতজ্ঞদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হব’।",
        "বল, ‘আল্লাহ তা থেকে তোমাদেরকে নাজাত দেন এবং প্রত্যেক বিপদ থেকে। তারপর তোমরা শিরক কর’।",
        "বল, ‘তিনি তো সক্ষম তোমাদের উপর থেকে অথবা তোমাদের পায়ের নীচ থেকে তোমাদের উপর আযাব প্রেরণ করতে, অথবা তোমাদেরকে বিভিন্ন সন্দেহপূর্ণ দলে বিভক্ত করতে এবং তোমাদের একদলকে অন্য দলের ভীতি আস্বাদন করাতে’। দেখ, কীভাবে আমি আয়াতসমূহ নানাভাবে বর্ণনা করি, যাতে তারা ভালভাবে বুঝতে পারে।",
        "আর তোমার কওম তা অস্বীকার করেছে, অথচ তা সত্য। বল, ‘আমি তোমাদের উপর তত্ত্বাবধায়ক নই’।",
        "প্রত্যেক সংবাদের নির্ধারিত সময় রয়েছে এবং অচিরেই তোমরা জানবে।",
        "আর যখন তুমি তাদেরকে দেখ, যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহের ব্যাপারে উপহাসমূলক সমালোচনায় রত আছে, তুমি তাদের থেকে মুখ ফিরিয়ে নাও, যতক্ষণ না তারা অন্য কথাবার্তায় লিপ্ত হয়। আর যদি শয়তান তোমাকে ভুলিয়ে দেয়, তবে স্মরণের পর যালিম সম্প্রদায়ের সাথে বসো না।",
        "আর যারা তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করে, যালিমদের কোন হিসেব তাদের উপর নেই। কিন্তু (তাদের কর্তব্য হচ্ছে) উপদেশ দেয়া, যাতে তারা তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করে।",
        "আর তুমি পরিত্যাগ কর তাদেরকে, যারা নিজদের দীনকে গ্রহণ করেছে খেল-তামাশা রূপে এবং প্রতারিত করেছে যাদেরকে দুনিয়ার জীবন। আর তুমি কুরআন দ্বারা উপদেশ দাও, যাতে কোন ব্যক্তি তার কৃতকর্মের দরুন ধ্বংসের শিকার না হয়, তার জন্য আল্লাহ ছাড়া নেই কোন অভিভাবক এবং নেই কোন সুপারিশকারী। আর যদি সে সব ধরণের মুক্তিপণও দেয়, তার থেকে তা গ্রহণ করা হবে না। এরাই তারা, যারা ধ্বংসের শিকার হয়েছে তাদের কৃতকর্মের দরুন। তাদের জন্য রয়েছে ফুটন্ত পানীয় এবং বেদনাদায়ক আযাব, যেহেতু তারা কুফরী করত।",

        "اور جو لوگ صبح وشام اپنی پروردگار سے دعا کرتے ہیں (اور) اس کی ذات کے طالب ہیں ان کو (اپنے پاس سے) مت نکالو۔ ان کے حساب (اعمال) کی جوابدہی تم پر کچھ نہیں اور تمہارے حساب کی جوابدہی ان پر کچھ نہیں (پس ایسا نہ کرنا) اگر ان کو نکالوگے تو ظالموں میں ہوجاؤ گے",
        "اور اسی طرح ہم نے بعض لوگوں کی بعض سے آزمائش کی ہے کہ (جو دولتمند ہیں وہ غریبوں کی نسبت) کہتے ہیں کیا یہی لوگ ہیں جن پر خدا نے ہم میں سے فضل کیا ہے (خدا نے فرمایا) بھلا خدا شکر کرنے والوں سے واقف نہیں؟",
        "اور جب تمہارے پاس ایسے لوگ آیا کریں جو ہماری آیتوں پر ایمان لاتے ہیں تو (ان سے) سلام علیکم کہا کرو خدا نے اپنی ذات (پاک) پر رحمت کو لازم کرلیا ہے کہ جو کوئی تم میں نادانی سے کوئی بری حرکت کر بیٹھے پھر اس کے بعد توبہ کرلے اور نیکوکار ہوجائے تو وہ بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "اور اس طرح ہم اپنی آیتیں کھول کھول کر بیان کرتے ہیں (تاکہ تم لوگ ان پر عمل کرو) اور اس لئے کہ گنہگاروں کا رستہ ظاہر ہوجائے",
        "(اے پیغمبر! کفار سے) کہہ دو کہ جن کو تم خدا کے سوا پکارتے ہو مجھے ان کی عبادت سے منع کیا گیا ہے۔ (یہ بھی) کہہ دو کہ میں تمہاری خواہشوں کی پیروی نہیں کروں گا ایسا کروں تو گمراہ ہوجاؤں اور ہدایت یافتہ لوگوں میں نہ رہوں",
        "کہہ دو کہ میں تو اپنے پروردگار کی دلیل روشن پر ہوں اور تم اس کی تکذیب کرتے ہو۔ جس چیز (یعنی عذاب) کے لئے تم جلدی کر رہے ہو وہ میرے پاس نہیں ہے (ایسا) حکم الله ہی کے اختیار میں ہے وہ سچی بات بیان فرماتا ہے اور وہ سب سے بہتر فیصلہ کرنے والا ہے",
        "کہہ دو کہ جس چیز کے لئے تم جلدی کر رہے ہو اگر وہ میرے اختیار میں ہوتی تو مجھ میں اور تم میں فیصلہ ہوچکا ہوتا۔ اور خدا ظالموں سے خوب واقف ہے",
        "اور اسی کے پاس غیب کی کنجیاں ہیں جن کو اس کے سوا کوئی نہیں جانتا۔ اور اسے جنگلوں اور دریاؤں کی سب چیزوں کا علم ہے۔ اور کوئی پتہ نہیں جھڑتا مگر وہ اس کو جانتا ہے اور زمین کے اندھیروں میں کوئی دانہ اور کوئی ہری اور سوکھی چیز نہیں ہے مگر کتاب روشن میں (لکھی ہوئی) ہے",
        "اور وہی تو ہے جو رات کو (سونے کی حالت میں) تمہاری روح قبض کرلیتا ہے اور جو کچھ تم دن میں کرتے ہو اس سے خبر رکھتا ہے پھر تمہیں دن کو اٹھا دیتا ہے تاکہ (یہی سلسلہ جاری رکھ کر زندگی کی) معین مدت پوری کردی جائے پھر تم (سب) کو اسی کی طرف لوٹ کر جانا ہے (اس روز) وہ تم کو تمہارے عمل جو تم کرتے ہو (ایک ایک کرکے) بتائے گا",
        "اور وہ اپنے بندوں پر غالب ہے۔ اور تم پر نگہبان مقرر کئے رکھتا ہے۔ یہاں تک کہ جب تم میں سے کسی کی موت آتی ہے تو ہمارے فرشتے اس کی روح قبض کرلیتے ہیں اور وہ کسی طرح کی کوتاہی نہیں کرتے",
        "پھر (قیامت کے دن تمام) لوگ اپنے مالک برحق خدا تعالیٰ کے پاس واپس بلائے جائیں گے۔ سن لو کہ حکم اسی کا ہے اور وہ نہایت جلد حساب لینے والا ہے",
        "کہو بھلا تم کو جنگلوں اور دریاؤں کے اندھیروں سے کون مخلصی دیتا ہے (جب) کہ تم اسے عاجزی اور نیاز پنہانی سے پکارتے ہو (اور کہتے ہو) اگر خدا ہم کو اس (تنگی) سے نجات بخشے تو ہم اس کے بہت شکر گزار ہوں",
        "کہو کہ خدا ہی تم کو اس (تنگی) سے اور ہر سختی سے نجات بخشتا ہے۔ پھر (تم) اس کے ساتھ شرک کرتے ہو",
        "کہہ دو کہ وہ (اس پر بھی) قدرت رکھتا ہے کہ تم پر اوپر کی طرف سے یا تمہارے پاؤں کے نیچے سے عذاب بھیجے یا تمہیں فرقہ فرقہ کردے اور ایک کو دوسرے (سے لڑا کر آپس) کی لڑائی کا مزہ چکھادے۔ دیکھو ہم اپنی آیتوں کو کس کس طرح بیان کرتے ہیں تاکہ یہ لوگ سمجھیں",
        "اور اس (قرآن) کو تمہاری قوم نے جھٹلایا حالانکہ وہ سراسر حق ہے۔ کہہ دو کہ میں تمہارا داروغہ نہیں ہوں",
        "ہر خبر کے لئے ایک وقت مقرر ہے اور تم کو عنقریب معلوم ہوجائے گا",
        "اور جب تم ایسے لوگوں کو دیکھو جو ہماری آیتوں کے بارے میں بیہودہ بکواس کر رہے ہوں تو ان سے الگ ہوجاؤ یہاں تک کہ اور باتوں میں مصروف ہوجائیں۔ اور اگر (یہ بات) شیطان تمہیں بھلا دے تو یاد آنے پر ظالم لوگوں کے ساتھ نہ بیٹھو",
        "اور پرہیزگاروں پر ان لوگوں کے حساب کی کچھ بھی جواب دہی نہیں ہاں نصیحت تاکہ وہ بھی پرہیزگار ہوں",
        "اور جن لوگوں نے اپنےدین کو کھیل اور تماشا بنا رکھا ہے اور دنیا کی زندگی نے ان کو دھوکے میں ڈال رکھا ہے ان سے کچھ کام نہ رکھو ہاں اس (قرآن) کے ذریعے سے نصیحت کرتے رہو تاکہ (قیامت کے دن) کوئی اپنے اعمال کی سزا میں ہلاکت میں نہ ڈالا جائے (اس روز) خدا کےسوا نہ تو کوئی اس کا دوست ہوگا اور نہ سفارش کرنے والا۔ اور اگر وہ ہر چیز (جو روئے زمین پر ہے بطور) معاوضہ دینا چاہے تو وہ اس سے قبول نہ ہو یہی لوگ ہیں کہ اپنے اعمال کے وبال میں ہلاکت میں ڈالے گئے ان کے لئے پینے کو کھولتا ہوا پانی اور دکھ دینے والا عذاب ہے اس لئے کہ کفر کرتے تھے",
        "کہو۔ کیا ہم خدا کے سوا ایسی چیز کو پکاریں جو نہ ہمارا بھلا کرسکے نہ برا۔ اور جب ہم کو خدا نے سیدھا رستہ دکھا دیا تو (کیا) ہم الٹے پاؤں پھر جائیں؟ (پھر ہماری ایسی مثال ہو) جیسے کسی کو جنات نے جنگل میں بھلا دیا ہو (اور وہ) حیران (ہو رہا ہو) اور اس کے کچھ رفیق ہوں جو اس کو رستے کی طرف بلائیں کہ ہمارے پاس چلا آ۔ کہہ دو کہ رستہ تو وہی ہے جو خدا نے بتایا ہے۔ اور ہمیں تو یہ حکم ملا ہے کہ ہم خدائے رب العالمین کے فرمانبردار ہوں",
        "اور یہ (بھی) کہ نماز پڑھتے رہو اور اس سے ڈرتے رہو۔ اور وہی تو ہے جس کے پاس تم جمع کئے جاؤ گے",
        "اور وہی تو ہے جس نے آسمانوں اور زمین کو تدبیر سے پیدا کیا ہے۔ اور جس دن وہ فرمائے گا کہ ہو جا تو (حشر برپا) ہوجائے گا ۔ اس کا ارشاد برحق ہے۔ اور جس دن صور پھونکا جائے گا (اس دن) اسی کی بادشاہت ہوگی۔ وہی پوشیدہ اور ظاہر (سب) کا جاننے والا ہے اور وہی دانا اور خبردار ہے",
        "اور (وہ وقت بھی یاد کرنے کے لائق ہے) جب ابراہیم نے اپنے باپ آزر سے کہا کہ تم بتوں کو کیا معبود بناتے ہو۔ میں دیکھتا ہوں کہ تم اور تمہاری قوم صریح گمراہی میں ہو",
        "اور ہم اس طرح ابراہیم کو آسمانوں اور زمین کے عجائبات دکھانے لگے تاکہ وہ خوب یقین کرنے والوں میں ہوجائیں",
        "(یعنی) جب رات نے ان کو (پردہٴ تاریکی سے) ڈھانپ لیا (تو آسمان میں) ایک ستارا نظر پڑا۔ کہنے لگے یہ میرا پروردگار ہے۔ جب وہ غائب ہوگیا تو کہنے لگے کہ مجھے غائب ہوجانے والے پسند نہیں",
        "پھر جب چاند کو دیکھا کہ چمک رہا ہے تو کہنے لگے یہ میرا پروردگار ہے۔ لیکن جب وہ بھی چھپ گیا تو بول اٹھے کہ میرا پروردگار مجھے سیدھا رستہ نہیں دکھائے گا تو میں ان لوگوں میں ہوجاؤں گا جو بھٹک رہے ہیں",
        "پھر جب سورج کو دیکھا کہ جگمگا رہا ہے تو کہنے لگے میرا پروردگار یہ ہے یہ سب سے بڑا ہے۔ مگر جب وہ بھی غروب ہوگیا تو کہنے لگے لوگو! جن چیزوں کو تم (خدا کا) شریک بناتے ہو میں ان سے بیزار ہوں",
        "میں نے سب سے یکسو ہو کر اپنے تئیں اسی ذات کی طرف متوجہ کیا جس نے آسمانوں اور زمین کو پیدا کیا ہے اور میں مشرکوں میں سے نہیں ہوں",
        "اور ان کی قوم ان سے بحث کرنے لگی تو انہوں نے کہا کہ تم مجھ سے خدا کے بارےمیں (کیا) بحث کرتے ہو اس نے تو مجھے سیدھا رستہ دکھا دیا ہے۔ اور جن چیزوں کو تم اس کا شریک بناتے ہو میں ان سے نہیں ڈرتا۔ ہاں جو میرا پروردگار چاہے۔ میرا پروردگار اپنے علم سے ہر چیز پر احاطہ کئے ہوئے ہے۔ کیا تم خیال نہیں کرتے۔",
        "بھلا میں ان چیزوں سے جن کو تم (خدا کا) شریک بناتے ہو کیونکرڈروں جب کہ تم اس سے نہیں ڈرتے کہ خدا کے ساتھ شریک بناتے ہو جس کی اس نے کوئی سند نازل نہیں کی۔ اب دونوں فریق میں سے کون سا فریق امن (اور جمعیت خاطر) کا مستحق ہے۔ اگر سمجھ رکھتے ہو (تو بتاؤ)",
        "جو لوگ ایمان لائے اور اپنے ایمان کو (شرک کے) ظلم سے مخلوط نہیں کیا ان کے امن (اور جمعیت خاطر) ہے اور وہی ہدایت پانے والے ہیں",
        "اور یہ ہماری دلیل تھی جو ہم نے ابراہیم کو ان کی قوم کے مقابلے میں عطا کی تھی۔ ہم جس کے چاہتے ہیں درجے بلند کردیتے ہیں۔ بےشک تمہارا پروردگار دانا اور خبردار ہے",
        "اور ہم نے ان کو اسحاق اور یعقوب بخشے۔ (اور) سب کو ہدایت دی۔ اور پہلے نوح کو بھی ہدایت دی تھی اور ان کی اولاد میں سے داؤد اور سلیمان اور ایوب اور یوسف اور موسیٰ اور ہارون کو بھی۔ اور ہم نیک لوگوں کو ایسا ہی بدلا دیا کرتے ہیں",
        "اور زکریا اور یحییٰ اور عیسیٰ اور الیاس کو بھی۔ یہ سب نیکوکار تھے",
        "اور اسمٰعیل اور الیسع اور یونس اور لوط کو بھی۔ اور ان سب کو جہان کے لوگوں پر فضلیت بخشی تھی",
        "اور بعض بعض کو ان کے باپ دادا اور اولاد اور بھائیوں میں سے بھی۔ اور ان کو برگزیدہ بھی کیا تھا اور سیدھا رستہ بھی دکھایا تھا",
        "یہ خدا کی ہدایت ہے اس پر اپنے بندوں میں سے جسے چاہے چلائے۔ اور اگر وہ لوگ شرک کرتے تو جو عمل وہ کرتے تھے سب ضائع ہوجاتے",
        "یہ وہ لوگ تھے جن کو ہم نے کتاب اور حکم (شریعت) اور نبوت عطا فرمائی تھی۔ اگر یہ (کفار) ان باتوں سے انکار کریں تو ہم نے ان پر (ایمان لانے کے لئے) ایسے لوگ مقرر کردیئے ہیں کہ وہ ان سے کبھی انکار کرنے والے نہیں",
        "یہ وہ لوگ ہیں جن کو خدا نے ہدایت دی تھی تو تم انہیں کی ہدایت کی پیروی کرو۔ کہہ دو کہ میں تم سے اس (قرآن) کا صلہ نہیں مانگتا۔ یہ تو جہان کے لوگوں کے لئےمحض نصیحت ہے",
        "اور ان لوگوں نے خدا کی قدر جیسی جاننی چاہیئے تھی نہ جانی۔ جب انہوں نے کہا کہ خدا نے انسان پر (وحی اور کتاب وغیرہ) کچھ بھی نازل نہیں کیا۔ کہو جو کتاب موسیٰ لے کر آئے تھے اسے کس نے نازل کیا تھا جو لوگوں کے لئے نور اور ہدایت تھی اور جسے تم نے علیحدہ علیحدہ اوراق (پر نقل) کر رکھا ہے ان (کے کچھ حصے) کو تو ظاہر کرتے ہو اور اکثر کو چھپاتے ہو۔ اور تم کو وہ باتیں سکھائی گئیں جن کو نہ تم جانتے تھے اور نہ تمہارے باپ دادا۔ کہہ دو (اس کتاب کو) خدا ہی نے (نازل کیا تھا) پھر ان کو چھوڑ دیا کہ اپنی بیہودہ بکواس میں کھیلتے رہیں",
        "اور (ویسی ہی) یہ کتاب ہے جسے ہم نے نازل کیا ہے بابرکت جو اپنے سے پہلی (کتابوں) کی تصدیق کرتی ہے اور (جو) اس لئے (نازل کی گئی ہے) کہ تم مکے اور اس کے آس پاس کے لوگوں کو آگاہ کردو۔ اور جو لوگ آخرت پر ایمان رکھتے ہیں وہ اس کتاب پر بھی ایمان رکھتے ہیں اور وہ اپنی نمازوں کی پوری خبر رکھتے ہیں",
        "اور اس سے بڑھ کر ظالم کون ہوگا جو خدا پر جھوٹ افتراء کرے۔ یا یہ کہے کہ مجھ پر وحی آئی ہے حالانکہ اس پر کچھ بھی وحی نہ آئی ہو اور جو یہ کہے کہ جس طرح کی کتاب خدا نے نازل کی ہے اس طرح کی میں بھی بنا لیتا ہوں۔ اور کاش تم ان ظالم (یعنی مشرک) لوگوں کو اس وقت دیکھو جب موت کی سختیوں میں (مبتلا) ہوں اور فرشتے (ان کی طرف عذاب کے لئے) ہاتھ بڑھا رہے ہوں کہ نکالو اپنی جانیں۔ آج تم کو ذلت کے عذاب کی سزا دی جائے گی اس لئے کہ تم خدا پر جھوٹ بولا کرتے تھے اور اس کی آیتوں سے سرکشی کرتے تھے",
        "اور جیسا ہم نے تم کو پہلی دفعہ پیدا کیا تھا ایسا ہی آج اکیلے اکیلے ہمارے پاس آئے اور جو (مال ومتاع) ہم نے تمہیں عطا فرمایا تھا وہ سب اپنی پیٹھ پیچھے چھوڑ آئے اور ہم تمہارے ساتھ تمہارے سفارشیوں کو بھی نہیں دیکھتے جن کی نسبت تم خیال کرتے تھے کہ وہ تمہارے (شفیع اور ہمارے) شریک ہیں۔ (آج) تمہارے آپس کے سب تعلقات منقطع ہوگئے اور جو دعوے تم کیا کرتے تھے سب جاتے رہے",
        "بے شک خدا ہی دانے اور گٹھلی کو پھاڑ کر (ان سے درخت وغیرہ) اگاتا ہے وہی جاندار کو بے جان سے نکالتا ہے اور وہی بےجان کا جاندار سے نکالنے والا ہے۔ یہی تو خدا ہے۔ پھر تم کہاں بہکے پھرتے ہو",
        "وہی (رات کے اندھیرے سے) صبح کی روشنی پھاڑ نکالتا ہے اور اسی نے رات کو (موجب) آرام (ٹھہرایا) اور سورج اور چاند کو (ذرائع) شمار بنایا ہے۔ یہ خدا کے (مقرر کئے ہوئے) اندازے ہیں جو غالب (اور) علم والا ہے",
        "اور وہی تو ہے جس نے تمہارے لئے ستارے بنائے تاکہ جنگلوں اور دریاؤں کے اندھیروں میں ان سے رستے معلوم کرو۔ عقل والوں کے لئے ہم نے اپنی آیتیں کھول کھول کر بیان کردی ہیں",
        "اور وہی تو ہے جس نے تم کو ایک شخص سے پیدا کیا۔ پھر (تمہارے لئے) ایک ٹھہرنے کی جگہ ہے اور ایک سپرد ہونے کی سمجھنے والوں کے لئے ہم نے (اپنی) آیتیں کھول کھول کر بیان کردی ہیں",
        "اور وہی تو ہے جو آسمان سے مینھ برساتا ہے۔ پھر ہم ہی (جو مینھ برساتے ہیں) اس سے ہر طرح کی روئیدگی اگاتے ہیں۔ پھر اس میں سے سبز سبز کونپلیں نکالتے ہیں۔ اور ان کونپلوں میں سے ایک دوسرے کے ساتھ جڑے ہوئے دانے نکالتے ہیں اور کھجور کے گابھے میں سے لٹکتے ہوئے گچھے اور انگوروں کے باغ اور زیتون اور انار جو ایک دوسرے سے ملتے جلتے بھی ہیں۔ اور نہیں بھی ملتے۔ یہ چیزیں جب پھلتی ہیں تو ان کے پھلوں پر اور (جب پکتی ہیں تو) ان کے پکنے پر نظر کرو۔ ان میں ان لوگوں کے لئے جو ایمان لاتے ہیں (قدرت خدا کی بہت سی) نشانیاں ہیں",
        "اور ان لوگوں نے جنوں کو خدا کا شریک ٹھہرایا۔ حالانکہ ان کو اسی نے پیدا کیا اور بےسمجھے (جھوٹ بہتان) اس کے لئے بیٹے اور بیٹیاں بنا کھڑی کیں وہ ان باتوں سے جو اس کی نسبت بیان کرتے ہیں پاک ہے اور (اس کی شان ان سے) بلند ہے",
        "(وہی) آسمانوں اور زمین کا پیدا کرنے والا (ہے)۔ اس کے اولاد کہاں سے ہو جب کہ اس کی بیوی ہی نہیں۔ اور اس نے ہر چیز کو پیدا کیا ہے۔ اور وہ ہر چیز سے باخبر ہے",
        "یہی (اوصاف رکھنے والا) خدا تمہارا پروردگار ہے۔ اس کے سوا کوئی معبود نہیں۔ (وہی) ہر چیز کا پیداکرنے والا (ہے) تو اسی کی عبادت کرو۔ اور وہ ہر چیز کا نگراں ہے",
        "(وہ ایسا ہے کہ) نگاہیں اس کا ادراک نہیں کرسکتیں اور وہ نگاہوں کا ادراک کرسکتا ہے اور وہ بھید جاننے والا خبردار ہے",
        "(اے محمدﷺ! ان سے کہہ دو کہ) تمہارے (پاس) پروردگار کی طرف سے (روشن) دلیلیں پہنچ چکی ہیں تو جس نے (ان کو آنکھ کھول کر) دیکھا اس نے اپنا بھلا کیا اور جو اندھا بنا رہا اس نے اپنے حق میں برا کیا۔ اور میں تمہارا نگہبان نہیں ہوں",
        "اور ہم اسی طرح اپنی آیتیں پھیر پھیر کر بیان کرتے ہیں تاکہ کافر یہ نہ کہیں کہ تم (یہ باتیں اہل کتاب سے) سیکھے ہوئے ہو اور تاکہ سمجھنے والے لوگوں کے لئے تشریح کردیں",
        "اور جو حکم تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے تمہارے پاس آتا ہے اسی کی پیروی کرو۔ اس (پروردگار) کے سوا کوئی معبود نہیں۔ اور مشرکوں سے کنارہ کرلو",
        "اور اگر خدا چاہتا تو یہ لوگ شرک نہ کرتے۔ اور (اے پیغمبر!) ہم نے تم کو ان پر نگہبان مقرر نہیں کیا۔ اور نہ تم ان کے داروغہ ہو",
        "اور جن لوگوں کو یہ مشرک خدا کے سوا پکارتے ہیں ان کو برا نہ کہنا کہ یہ بھی کہیں خدا کو بےادبی سے بے سمجھے برا (نہ) کہہ بیٹھیں۔ اس طرح ہم نے ہر ایک فرقے کے اعمال (ان کی نظروں میں) اچھے کر دکھائے ہیں۔ پھر ان کو اپنے پروردگار ک طرف لوٹ کر جانا ہے تب وہ ان کو بتائے گا کہ وہ کیا کیا کرتے تھے",
        "اور یہ لوگ خدا کی سخت سخت قسمیں کھاتے ہیں کہ اگر ان کے پاس کوئی نشانی آئے تو وہ اس پر ضروری ایمان لے آئیں۔ کہہ دو کہ نشانیاں تو سب خدا ہی کے پاس ہیں۔ اور (مومنو!) تمہیں کیا معلوم ہے (یہ تو ایسے بدبخت ہیں کہ ان کے پاس) نشانیاں آ بھی جائیں تب بھی ایمان نہ لائیں",
        "اور ہم ان کے دلوں اور آنکھوں کو الٹ دیں گے (تو) جیسے یہ اس (قرآن) پر پہلی دفعہ ایمان نہیں لائے (ویسے پھر نہ لائیں گے) اور ان کو چھوڑ دیں گے کہ اپنی سرکشی میں بہکتے رہیں",
        "اور اگر ہم ان پر فرشتے بھی اتار دیتے اور مردے بھی ان سے گفتگو کرنے لگتے اور ہم سب چیزوں کو ان کے سامنے لا موجود بھی کر دیتے تو بھی یہ ایمان لانے والے نہ تھے اِلّا ماشائالله بات یہ ہے کہ یہ اکثر نادان ہیں",
        "اور اسی طرح ہم نے شیطان (سیرت) انسانوں اور جنوں کو ہر پیغمبر کا دشمن بنا دیا تھا وہ دھوکا دینے کے لیے ایک دوسرے کے دل میں ملمع کی باتیں ڈالتے رہتے تھے اور اگر تمہارا پروردگار چاہتا تو وہ ایسا نہ کرتے تو ان کو اور جو کچھ یہ افتراء کرتے ہیں اسے چھوڑ دو",
        "اور (وہ ایسے کام) اس لیے بھی (کرتے تھے) کہ جو لوگ آخرت پر ایمان نہیں رکھتے ان کے دل ان کی باتوں پر مائل ہوں اور وہ انہیں پسند کریں اور جو کام وہ کرتے تھے وہ ہی کرنے لگیں",
        "(کہو) کیا میں خدا کے سوا اور منصف تلاش کروں حالانکہ اس نے تمہاری طرف واضع المطالب کتاب بھیجی ہے اور جن لوگوں کو ہم نے کتاب (تورات) دی ہے وہ جانتے ہیں کہ وہ تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے برحق نازل ہوئی ہے تو تم ہرگز شک کرنے والوں میں نہ ہونا",
        "اور تمہارے پروردگار کی باتیں سچائی اور انصاف میں پوری ہیں اس کی باتوں کو کوئی بدلنے والا نہیں اور وہ سنتا جانتا ہے",
        "اور اکثر لوگ جو زمین پر آباد ہیں (گمراہ ہیں) اگر تم ان کا کہا مان لو گے تو وہ تمہیں خدا کا رستہ بھلا دیں گے یہ محض خیال کے پیچھے چلتے اور نرے اٹکل کے تیر چلاتے ہیں",
        "تمہارا پروردگار ان لوگوں کو خوب جانتا ہے جو اس کے رستے سے بھٹکے ہوئے ہیں اور ان سے بھی خوب واقف ہے جو رستے پر چل رہے ہیں",
        "تو جس چیز پر (ذبح کے وقت) خدا کا نام لیا جائے اگر تم اس کی آیتوں پر ایمان رکھتے ہو تو اسے کھا لیا کرو",
        "اور سبب کیا ہے کہ جس چیز پر خدا کا نام لیا جائے تم اسے نہ کھاؤ حالانکہ جو چیزیں اس نے تمہارے لیے حرام ٹھیرا دی ہیں وہ ایک ایک کر کے بیان کر دی ہیں (بے شک ان کو نہیں کھانا چاہیے) مگر اس صورت میں کہ ان کے (کھانے کے) لیے ناچار ہو جاؤ اور بہت سے لوگ بےسمجھے بوجھے اپنے نفس کی خواہشوں سے لوگوں کو بہکا رہے ہیں کچھ شک نہیں کہ ایسے لوگوں کو جو (خدا کی مقرر کی ہوئی) حد سے باہر نکل جاتے ہیں تمہارا پروردگار خوب جانتا ہے",
        "اور ظاہری اور پوشیدہ (ہر طرح کا) گناہ ترک کر دو جو لوگ گناہ کرتے ہیں وہ عنقریب اپنے کئے کی سزا پائیں گے",
        "اور جس چیز پر خدا کا نام نہ لیا جائے اسے مت کھاؤ کہ اس کا کھانا گناہ ہے اور شیطان (لوگ) اپنے رفیقوں کے دلوں میں یہ بات ڈالتے ہیں کہ تم سے جھگڑا کریں اور اگر تم لوگ ان کے کہے پر چلے تو بےشک تم بھی مشرک ہوئے",
        "بھلا جو پہلے مردہ تھا پھر ہم نے اس کو زندہ کیا اور اس کے لیے روشنی کر دی جس کے ذریعے سے وہ لوگوں میں چلتا پھرتا ہے کہیں اس شخص جیسا ہو سکتا ہے جو اندھیرے میں پڑا ہوا ہو اور اس سے نکل ہی نہ سکے اسی طرح کافر جو عمل کر رہے ہیں وہ انہیں اچھے معلوم ہوتے ہیں",
        "اور اسی طرح ہم نے ہر بستی میں بڑے بڑے مجرم پیدا کئے کہ ان میں مکاریاں کرتے رہیں اور جو مکاریاں یہ کرتے ہیں ان کا نقصان انہیں کو ہے اور (اس سے) بےخبر ہیں",
        "اور جب ان کے پاس کوئی آیت آتی ہے تو کہتے ہیں کہ جس طرح کی رسالت خدا کے پیغمبروں کو ملی ہے جب تک اسی طرح کی رسالت ہم کو نہ ملے ہم ہرگز ایمان نہیں لائیں گے اس کو خدا ہی خوب جانتا ہے کہ (رسالت کا کون سا محل ہے اور) وہ اپنی پیغمبری کسے عنایت فرمائے جو لوگ جرم کرتے ہیں ان کو خدا کے ہاں ذلّت اور عذابِ شدید ہوگا اس لیے کہ مکّاریاں کرتے تھے",
        "تو جس شخص کو خدا چاہتا ہے کہ ہدایت بخشے اس کا سینہ اسلام کے لیے کھول دیتا ہے اور جسے چاہتا ہے کہ گمراہ کرے اس کا سینہ تنگ اور گھٹا ہوا کر دیتا ہے گویا وہ آسمان پر چڑھ رہا ہے اس طرح خدا ان لوگوں پر جو ایمان نہیں لاتے عذاب بھیجتا ہے",
        "اور یہی تمہارے پروردگار کا سیدھا رستہ ہے جو لوگ غور کرنے والے ہیں ان کے لیے ہم نے اپنی آیتیں کھول کھول کر بیان کر دی ہیں",
        "ان کے لیے ان کے اعمال کے صلے میں پروردگار کے ہاں سلامتی کا گھر ہے اور وہی ان کا دوستدار ہے",
        "اور جس دن وہ سب (جنّ وانس) کو جمع کرے گا (اور فرمائے گا کہ) اے گروہ جنّات تم نے انسانوں سے بہت (فائدے) حاصل کئے تو جو انسانوں میں ان کے دوستدار ہوں گے وہ کہیں گے کہ پروردگار ہم ایک دوسرے سے فائدہ اٹھاتے رہے اور (آخر) اس وقت کو پہنچ گئے جو تو نے ہمارے لیے مقرر کیا تھا خدا فرمائے گا (اب) تمہارا ٹھکانہ دوزخ ہے ہمیشہ اس میں (جلتے) رہو گے مگر جو خدا چاہے بےشک تمہارا پروردگار دانا اور خبردار ہے",
        "اور اسی طرح ہم ظالموں کو ان کے اعمال کے سبب جو وہ کرتے تھے ایک دوسرے پر مسلط کر دیتے ہیں",
        "اے جنّوں اور انسانوں کی جماعت کیا تمہارے پاس تم ہی میں سے پیغمبر نہیں آتے رہے جو میری آیتیں تم کو پڑھ پڑھ کر سناتے اور اس دن کے سامنے آموجود ہونے سے ڈراتے تھے وہ کہیں گے کہ (پروردگار) ہمیں اپنے گناہوں کا اقرار ہے ان لوگوں کو دنیاکی زندگی نے دھوکے میں ڈال رکھا تھا اور (اب) خود اپنے اوپر گواہی دی کہ کفر کرتے تھے",
        "(اے محمدﷺ!) یہ (جو پیغمبر آتے رہے اور کتابیں نازل ہوتی رہیں تو) اس لیے کہ تمہارا پروردگار ایسا نہیں کہ بستیوں کو ظلم سے ہلاک کر دے اور وہاں کے رہنے والوں کو (کچھ بھی) خبر نہ ہو",

        "اور تمہارا پروردگار بےپروا (اور) صاحب رحمت ہے اگر چاہے (تو اے بندوں) تمہیں نابود کر دے اور تمہارے بعد جن لوگوں کو چاہے تمہارا جانشین بنا دے جیسا تم کو بھی دوسرے لوگوں کی نسل سے پیدا کیا ہے",
        "کچھ شک نہیں کہ جو وعدہ تم سے کیا جاتا ہے وہ (وقوع میں) آنے والا ہے اور تم (خدا کو) مغلوب نہیں کر سکتے",
        "کہہ دو کہ لوگو تم اپنی جگہ عمل کئے جاؤ میں (اپنی جگہ) عمل کئے جاتا ہوں عنقریب تم کو معلوم ہو جائے گا کہ آخرت میں (بہشت) کس کا گھر ہوگا کچھ شک نہیں کہ مشرک نجات نہیں پانے کے",
        "اور (یہ لوگ) خدا ہی کی پیدا کی ہوئی چیزوں یعنی کھیتی اور چوپایوں میں خدا کا بھی ایک حصہ مقرر کرتے ہیں اور اپنے خیال (باطل) سے کہتے ہیں کہ یہ (حصہ) تو خدا کا اور یہ ہمارے شریکوں (یعنی بتوں) کا تو جو حصہ ان کے شریکوں کا ہوتا ہے وہ تو خدا کی طرف نہیں جا سکتا اور جو حصہ خدا کا ہوتا ہے وہ ان کے شریکوں کی طرف جا سکتا ہے یہ کیسا برا انصاف ہے",
        "اسی طرح بہت سے مشرکوں کو ان کے شریکوں نے ان کے بچوں کو جان سے مار ڈالنا اچھا کر دکھایا ہے تاکہ انہیں ہلاکت میں ڈال دیں اور ان کے دین کو ان پر خلط ملط کر دیں اور اگر خدا چاہتا تو وہ ایسا نہ کرتے تو ان کو چھوڑ دو کہ وہ جانیں اور ان کا جھوٹ",
        "اور اپنے خیال سے یہ بھی کہتے ہیں کہ یہ چارپائے اور کھیتی منع ہے اسے اس شخص کے سوا جسے ہم چاہیں کوئی نہ کھائے اور (بعض) چارپائے ایسے ہیں کہ ان کی پیٹ پر چڑھنا منع کر دیا گیا ہے اور بعض مویشی ایسے ہیں جن پر (ذبح کرتے وقت) خدا کا نام نہیں لیتے سب خدا پر جھوٹ ہے وہ عنقریب ان کو ان کے جھوٹ کا بدلہ دے گا",
        "اور یہ بھی کہتے ہیں کہ جو بچہ ان چارپایوں کے پیٹ میں ہے وہ خاص ہمارے مردوں کے لئے ہے اور ہماری عورتوں کو (اس کا کھانا) حرام ہے اور اگر وہ بچہ مرا ہوا ہو تو سب اس میں شریک ہیں (یعنی اسے مرد اور عورتیں سب کھائیں) عنقریب خدا ان کو ان کے ڈھکوسلوں کی سزا دے گا بےشک وہ حکمت والا خبردار ہے",
        "جن لوگوں نے اپنی اولاد کو بیوقوفی سے بے سمجھی سے قتل کیا اور خدا پر افترا کر کے اس کی عطا فرمائی کی ہوئی روزی کو حرام ٹہرایا وہ گھاٹے میں پڑ گئے وہ بےشبہ گمراہ ہیں اور ہدایت یافتہ نہیں ہیں",
        "اور خدا ہی تو ہے جس نے باغ پیدا کئے چھتریوں پر چڑھائے ہوئے بھی اور جو چھتریوں پر نہیں چڑھائے ہوئے وہ بھی اور کھجور اور کھیتی جن کے طرح طرح کے پھل ہوتے ہیں اور زیتون اور انار جو (بعض باتوں میں) ایک دوسرے سے ملتے ہیں جب یہ چیزیں پھلیں تو ان کے پھل کھاؤ اور جس دن (پھل توڑو اور کھیتی) کاٹو تو خدا کا حق بھی اس میں سے ادا کرو اور بےجا نہ اڑاؤ کہ خدا بیجا اڑانے والوں کو دوست نہیں رکھتا",
        "اور چارپایوں میں بوجھ اٹھانے والے (یعنی بڑے بڑے) بھی پیدا کئے اور زمین سے لگے ہوئے (یعنی چھوٹے چھوٹے) بھی (پس) خدا کا دیا ہوا رزق کھاؤ اور شیطان کے قدموں پر نہ چلو وہ تمہارا صریح دشمن ہے",
        "(یہ بڑے چھوٹے چارپائے) آٹھ قسم کے (ہیں) دو (دو) بھیڑوں میں سے اور دو (دو) بکریوں میں سے (یعنی ایک ایک نر اور اور ایک ایک مادہ) (اے پیغمبر ان سے) پوچھو کہ (خدا نے) دونوں (کے) نروں کو حرام کیا ہے یا دونوں (کی) مادنیوں کو یا جو بچہ مادنیوں کے پیٹ میں لپٹ رہا ہو اسے اگر سچے ہو تو مجھے سند سے بتاؤ",
        "اور دو (دو) اونٹوں میں سے اور دو (دو) گایوں میں سے (ان کے بارے میں بھی ان سے) پوچھو کہ (خدا نے) دونوں (کے) نروں کو حرام کیا ہے یا دونوں (کی) مادنیوں کو یا جو بچہ مادنیوں کے پیٹ میں لپٹ رہا ہو اس کو بھلا جس وقت خدا نے تم کو اس کا حکم دیا تھا تم اس وقت موجود تھے؟ تو اس شخص سے زیادہ کون ظالم ہے جو خدا پر جھوٹ افتراء کرے تاکہ اِز راہ بے دانشی لوگوں کو گمراہ کرے کچھ شک نہیں کہ خدا ظالم لوگوں کو ہدایت نہیں دیتا",
        "کہو کہ جو احکام مجھ پر نازل ہوئے ہیں ان میں کوئی چیز جسے کھانے والا کھائے حرام نہیں پاتا بجز اس کے کہ وہ مرا ہوا جانور یا بہتا لہو یا سور کا گوشت کہ یہ سب ناپاک ہیں یا کوئی گناہ کی چیز ہو کہ اس پر خدا کے سوا کسی اور کا نام لیا گیا ہو اور اگر کوئی مجبور ہو جائے لیکن نہ تو نافرمانی کرے اور نہ حد سے باہر نکل جائے تو تمہارا پروردگار بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "اور یہودیوں پر ہم نے سب ناخن والے جانور حرام کر دئیے تھے اور گایوں اور بکریوں سے ان کی چربی حرام کر دی تھی سوا اس کے جو ان کی پیٹھ پر لگی ہو یا اوجھڑی میں ہو یا ہڈی میں ملی ہو یہ سزا ہم نے ان کو ان کی شرارت کے سبب دی تھی اور ہم تو سچ کہنے والے ہیں",
        "اور اگر یوں لوگ تمہاری تکذیب کریں تو کہہ دو تمہارا پروردگار صاحب رحمت وسیع ہے مگر اس کا عذاب گنہ گاروں لوگوں سے نہیں ٹلے گا",
        "جو لوگ شرک کرتے ہیں وہ کہیں گے کہ اگر خدا چاہتا تو ہم شرک نہ کرتے اور نہ ہمارے باپ دادا (شرک کرتے) اور نہ ہم کسی چیز کو حرام ٹھہراتے اسی طرح ان لوگوں نے تکذیب کی تھی جو ان سے پہلے تھے یہاں تک کہ ہمارے عذاب کا مزہ چکھ کر رہے کہہ دو کیا تمہارے پاس کوئی سند ہے (اگر ہے) تو اسے ہمارے سامنے نکالو تم محض خیال کے پیچھے چلتے اور اٹکل کی تیر چلاتے ہو",
        "کہہ دو کہ خدا ہی کی حجت غالب ہے اگر وہ چاہتا تو تم سب کو ہدایت دے دیتا",
        "کہو کہ اپنے گواہوں کو لاؤ جو بتائیں کہ خدا نے یہ چیزیں حرام کی ہیں پھر اگر وہ (آ کر) گواہی دیں تو تم ان کے ساتھ گواہی نہ دینا اور نہ ان لوگوں کی خواہشوں کی پیروی کرنا جو ہماری آیتوں کو جھٹلاتے ہیں اور آخرت پر ایمان نہیں لاتے اور (بتوں کو) اپنے پروردگار کے برابر ٹھہراتے ہیں",
        "کہہ کہ (لوگو) آؤ میں تمہیں وہ چیزیں پڑھ کر سناؤں جو تمہارے پروردگار نے تم پر حرام کر دی ہیں (ان کی نسبت اس نے اس طرح ارشاد فرمایا ہے) کہ کسی چیز کو خدا کا شریک نہ بنانا اور ماں باپ (سے بدسلوکی نہ کرنا بلکہ) سلوک کرتے رہنا اور ناداری (کے اندیشے) سے اپنی اولاد کو قتل نہ کرنا کیونکہ تم کو اور ان کو ہم ہی رزق دیتے ہیں اور بےحیائی کے کام ظاہر ہوں یا پوشیدہ ان کے پاس نہ پھٹکنا اور کسی جان (والے) کو جس کے قتل کو خدا نے حرام کر دیا ہے قتل نہ کرنا مگر جائز طور پر (یعنی جس کا شریعت حکم دے) ان باتوں کا وہ تمہیں ارشاد فرماتا ہے تاکہ تم سمجھو",
        "اور یتیم کے مال کے پاس بھی نہ جانا مگر ایسے طریق سے کہ بہت ہی پسندیدہ ہو یہاں تک کہ وہ جوانی کو پہنچ جائے اور ناپ تول انصاف کے ساتھ پوری پوری کیا کرو ہم کسی کو تکلیف نہیں دیتے مگر اس کی طاقت کے مطابق اور جب (کسی کی نسبت) کوئی بات کہو تو انصاف سے کہو گو وہ (تمہارا) رشتہ دار ہی ہو اور خدا کے عہد کو پورا کرو ان باتوں کا خدا تمہیں حکم دیتا ہے تاکہ تم نصحیت کرو",
        "اور یہ کہ میرا سیدھا رستہ یہی ہے تو تم اسی پر چلنا اور اور رستوں پر نہ چلنا کہ (ان پر چل کر) خدا کے رستے سے الگ ہو جاؤ گے ان باتوں کا خدا تمہیں حکم دیتا ہے تاکہ تم پرہیزگار بنو",
        "(ہاں) پھر (سن لو کہ) ہم نے موسیؑ کو کتاب عنایت کی تھی تاکہ ان لوگوں پر جو نیکوکار ہیں نعمت پوری کر دیں اور (اس میں) ہر چیز کا بیان (ہے) اور ہدایت (ہے) اور رحمت ہے تاکہ (ان کی امت کے) لوگ اپنے پروردگار کے رُوبرو حاضر ہونے کا یقین کریں",
        "اور (اے کفر کرنے والوں) یہ کتاب بھی ہمیں نے اتاری ہے برکت والی تو اس کی پیروی کرو اور (خدا سے) ڈرو تاکہ تم پر مہربانی کی جائے",
        "(اور اس لیے اتاری ہے) کہ (تم یوں نہ) کہو کہ ہم سے پہلے دو ہی گروہوں پر کتابیں اتری تھیں اور ہم ان کے پڑھنے سے (معذور اور) بےخبر تھے",
        "یا (یہ نہ) کہو کہ اگر ہم پر بھی کتاب نازل ہوتی تو ہم ان لوگوں کی نسبت کہیں سیدھے رستے پر ہوتے سو تمہارے پاس تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے دلیل اور ہدایت اور رحمت آ گئی ہے تو اس سے بڑھ کر ظالم کون ہوگا جو خدا کی آیتوں کی تکذیب کرے اور ان سے (لوگوں کو) پھیرے جو لوگ ہماری آیتوں سے پھیرتے ہیں اس پھیرنے کے سبب ہم ان کو برے عذاب کی سزا دیں گے",
        "یہ اس کے سوا اور کس بات کے منتظر ہیں کہ ان کے پاس فرشتے آئیں یا خود تمہارا پروردگار آئے یا تمہارے پروردگار کی کچھ نشانیاں آئیں (مگر) جس روز تمہارے پروردگار کی کچھ نشانیاں آ جائیں گی تو جو شخص پہلے ایمان نہیں لایا ہوگا اس وقت اسے ایمان لانا کچھ فائدہ نہیں دے گا یا اپنے ایمان (کی حالت) میں نیک عمل نہیں کئے ہوں گے (تو گناہوں سے توبہ کرنا مفید نہ ہوگا اے پیغمبر ان سے) کہہ دو کہ تم بھی انتظار کرو ہم بھی انتظار کرتے ہیں",
        "جن لوگوں نے اپنے دین میں (بہت سے) رستے نکالے اور کئی کئی فرقے ہو گئے ان سے تم کو کچھ کام نہیں ان کا کام خدا کے حوالے پھر جو کچھ وہ کرتے رہے ہیں وہ ان کو (سب) بتائے گا",
        "اور جو کوئی (خدا کے حضور) نیکی لے کر آئے گا اس کو ویسی دس نیکیاں ملیں گی اور جو برائی لائے گا اسے سزا ویسے ہی ملے گی اور ان پر ظلم نہیں کیا جائے گا",
        "کہہ دو کہ مجھے میرے پروردگار نے سیدھا رستہ دکھا دیا ہے (یعنی دین صحیح) مذہب ابراہیم کا جو ایک (خدا) ہی کی طرف کے تھے اور مشرکوں میں سے نہ تھے",
        "(یہ بھی) کہہ دو کہ میری نماز اور میری عبادت اور میرا جینا اور میرا مرنا سب خدائے رب العالمین ہی کے لیے ہے",
        "جس کا کوئی شریک نہیں اور مجھ کو اسی بات کا حکم ملا ہے اور میں سب سے اول فرمانبردار ہوں",
        "کہو کیا میں خدا کے سوا اور پروردگار تلاش کروں اور وہی تو ہر چیز کا مالک ہے اور جو کوئی (برا) کام کرتا ہے تو اس کا ضرر اسی کو ہوتا ہے اور کوئی شخص کسی (کے گناہ) کا بوجھ نہیں اٹھائے گا پھر تم سب کو اپنے پروردگار کی طرف لوٹ کا جانا ہے تو جن جن باتوں میں تم اختلاف کیا کرتے تھے وہ تم کو بتائے گا",
        "اور وہی تو ہے جس نے زمین میں تم کو اپنا نائب بنایا اور ایک کے دوسرے پر درجے بلند کئے تاکہ جو کچھ اس نے تمہیں بخشا ہے اس میں تمہاری آزمائش ہے بےشک تمہارا پروردگار جلد عذاب دینے والا ہے اور بےشک وہ بخشنے والا مہربان بھی ہے"
