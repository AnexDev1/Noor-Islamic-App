        "Alif-Lãm-Ra. These are the verses of the Book, rich in wisdom.",
        "Is it astonishing to people that We have sent revelation to a man from among themselves, ˹instructing him,˺ “Warn humanity and give good news to the believers that they will have an honourable status with their Lord.”? Yet the disbelievers said, “Indeed, this ˹man˺ is clearly a magician!”",
        "Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne, conducting every affair. None can intercede except by His permission. That is Allah—your Lord, so worship Him ˹alone˺. Will you not then be mindful?",
        "To Him is your return all together. Allah’s promise is ˹always˺ true. Indeed, He originates the creation then resurrects it so that He may justly reward those who believe and do good. But those who disbelieve will have a boiling drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief.",
        "He is the One Who made the sun a radiant source and the moon a reflected light, with precisely ordained phases, so that you may know the number of years and calculation ˹of time˺. Allah did not create all this except for a purpose. He makes the signs clear for people of knowledge.",
        "Surely in the alternation of the day and the night, and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are truly signs for those mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "Indeed, those who do not expect to meet Us, being pleased and content with this worldly life, and who are heedless of Our signs",
        "they will have the Fire as a home because of what they have committed.",
        "Surely those who believe and do good, their Lord will guide them ˹to Paradise˺ through their faith, rivers will flow under their feet in the Gardens of Bliss",
        "in which their prayer will be, “Glory be to You, O  Allah!” and their greeting will be, “Peace!” and their closing prayer will be, “All praise is for Allah—Lord of all worlds!”",
        "If Allah were to hasten evil for people as they wish to hasten good, they would have certainly been doomed. But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander blindly in their defiance.",
        "Whenever someone is touched by hardship, they cry out to Us, whether lying on their side, sitting, or standing. But when We relieve their hardship, they return to their old ways as if they had never cried to Us to remove any hardship! This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors have been made appealing to them.",
        "We surely destroyed ˹other˺ peoples before you when they did wrong, and their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they would not believe! This is how We reward the wicked people.",
        "Then We made you their successors in the land to see how you would act.",
        "When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who do not expect to meet Us say ˹to the Prophet˺, “Bring us a different Quran or make some changes in it.” Say ˹to them˺, “It is not for me to change it on my own. I only follow what is revealed to me. I fear, if I were to disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.”",
        "Say, “Had Allah willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I had lived my whole life among you before this ˹revelation˺. Do you not understand?”",
        "Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah or deny His revelations? Indeed, the wicked will never succeed.",
        "They worship besides Allah others who can neither harm nor benefit them, and say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Are you informing Allah of something He does not know in the heavens or the earth? Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺!”",
        "Humanity was once nothing but a single community ˹of believers˺, but then they differed. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord, their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺.",
        "They ask, “Why has no ˹other˺ sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹The knowledge of˺ the unseen is with Allah alone. So wait! I too am waiting with you.”",
        "When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with a hardship, they swiftly devise plots against Our revelations! Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah is swifter in devising ˹punishment˺. Surely Our messenger-angels record whatever you devise.”",
        "He is the One Who enables you to travel through land and sea. And it so happens that you are on ships, sailing with a favourable wind, to the passengers’ delight. Suddenly, the ships are overcome by a gale wind and those on board are overwhelmed by waves from every side, and they assume they are doomed. They cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion, “If You save us from this, we will certainly be grateful.”",
        "But as soon as He rescues them, they transgress in the land unjustly. O  humanity! Your transgression is only against your own souls. ˹There is only˺ brief enjoyment in this worldly life, then to Us is your return, and then We will inform you of what you used to do.",
        "The life of this world is just like rain We send down from the sky, producing a mixture of plants which humans and animals consume. Then just as the earth looks its best, perfectly beautified, and its people think they have full control over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, so We mow it down as if it never flourished yesterday! This is how We make the signs clear for people who reflect.",
        "And Allah invites ˹all˺ to the Home of Peace and guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.",
        "Those who do good will have the finest reward and ˹even˺ more. Neither gloom nor disgrace will cover their faces. It is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever.",
        "As for those who commit evil, the reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. Humiliation will cover them—with no one to protect them from Allah—as if their faces were covered with patches of the night’s deep darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.",
        "˹Consider˺ the Day We will gather them all together then say to those who associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺, “Stay in your places—you and your associate-gods.” We will separate them from each other, and their associate-gods will say, “It was not us that you worshipped!",
        "Allah is sufficient as a Witness between each of us that we were totally unaware of your worship.”",
        "Then and there every soul will face ˹the consequences of˺ what it had done. They all will be returned to Allah—their True Master. And whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them.",
        "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Who owns ˹your˺ hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living? And who conducts every affair?” They will ˹surely˺ say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not then fear ˹Him˺?",
        "That is Allah—your True Lord. So what is beyond the truth except falsehood? How can you then be turned away?”",
        "And so your Lord’s decree has been proven true against the rebellious—that they will never believe.",
        "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Can any of your associate-gods originate creation and then resurrect it?” Say, “˹Only˺ Allah originates creation and then resurrects it. How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺?”",
        "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Can any of your associate-gods guide to the truth?” Say, “˹Only˺ Allah guides to the truth.” Who then is more worthy to be followed: the One Who guides to the truth or those who cannot find the way unless guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge?",
        "Most of them follow nothing but ˹inherited˺ assumptions. ˹And˺ surely assumptions can in no way replace the truth. Allah is indeed All-Knowing of what they do.",
        "It is not ˹possible˺ for this Quran to have been produced by anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a confirmation of what came before, and an explanation of the Scripture. It is, without a doubt, from the Lord of all worlds.",
        "Or do they claim, “He made it up!”? Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Produce one sûrah like it then, and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!”",
        "In fact, they ˹hastily˺ rejected the Book without comprehending it and before the fulfilment of its warnings. Similarly, those before them were in denial. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers!",
        "Some of them will ˹eventually˺ believe in it; others will not. And your Lord knows best the corruptors.",
        "If they deny you, then say, “My deeds are mine and your deeds are yours. You are free of what I do and I am free of what you do!”",
        "Some of them listen to what you say, but can you make the deaf hear even though they do not understand?",
        "And some of them look at you, but can you guide the blind even though they cannot see?",
        "Indeed, Allah does not wrong people in the least, but it is people who wrong themselves.",
        "On the Day He will gather them, it will be as if they had not stayed ˹in the world˺ except for an hour of a day, ˹as though they were only˺ getting to know one another. Lost indeed will be those who denied the meeting with Allah, and were not ˹rightly˺ guided!",
        "Whether We show you ˹O Prophet˺ some of what We threaten them with, or cause you to die ˹before that˺, to Us is their return and Allah is a Witness over what they do.",
        "And for every community there is a messenger. After their messenger has come, judgment is passed on them in all fairness, and they are not wronged.",
        "They ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass if what you say is true?”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of Allah.” For each community there is an appointed term. When their time arrives, they cannot delay it for a moment, nor could they advance it.",
        "Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Imagine if His torment were to overcome you by night or day—do the wicked realize what they are ˹really˺ asking Him to hasten?",
        "Will you believe in it only after it has overtaken you? Now? But you always wanted to hasten it!”",
        "Then the wrongdoers will be told, “Taste the torment of eternity! Are you not rewarded except for what you used to commit?”",
        "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺, “Is this true?” Say, “Yes, by my Lord! Most certainly it is true! And you will have no escape.”",
        "If every wrongdoer were to possess everything in the world, they would surely ransom themselves with it. They will hide ˹their˺ remorse when they see the torment. And they will be judged in all fairness, and none will be wronged.",
        "Surely to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Surely Allah’s promise is ˹always˺ true, but most of them do not know.",
        "He ˹is the One Who˺ gives life and causes death, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.",
        "O humanity! Indeed, there has come to you a warning from your Lord, a cure for what is in the hearts, a guide, and a mercy for the believers.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “In Allah’s grace and mercy let them rejoice. That is far better than whatever ˹wealth˺ they amass.”",
        "Ask ˹the pagans, O  Prophet˺, “Have you seen that which Allah has sent down for you as a provision, of which you have made some lawful and some unlawful?” Say, “Has Allah given you authorization, or are you fabricating lies against Allah?”",
        "What do those who fabricate lies against Allah expect on Judgment Day? Surely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most of them are ungrateful.",
        "There is no activity you may be engaged in ˹O Prophet˺ or portion of the Quran you may be reciting, nor any deed you ˹all˺ may be doing except that We are a Witness over you while doing it. Not ˹even˺ an atom’s weight is hidden from your Lord on earth or in heaven; nor anything smaller or larger than that, but is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record.",
        "There will certainly be no fear for the close servants of Allah, nor will they grieve.",
        "˹They are˺ those who are faithful and are mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "For them is good news in this worldly life and the Hereafter. There is no change in the promise of Allah. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.",
        "Do not let their words grieve you ˹O Prophet˺. Surely all honour and power belongs to Allah. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "Certainly to Allah ˹alone˺ belong all those in the heavens and all those on the earth. And what do those who associate others with Allah really follow? They follow nothing but assumptions and do nothing but lie.",
        "He is the One Who has made the night for you to rest in and the day bright. Surely in this are signs for people who listen.",
        "They say, “Allah has offspring.” Glory be to Him! He is the Self-Sufficient. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. You have no proof of this! Do you say about Allah what you do not know?",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, those who fabricate lies against Allah will never succeed.”",
        "˹It is only˺ a brief enjoyment in this world, then to Us is their return, then We will make them taste the severe punishment for their disbelief.",
        "Relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of Noah when he said to his people, “O my People! If my presence and my reminders to you of Allah’s signs are unbearable to you, then ˹know that˺ I have put my trust in Allah. So devise a plot along with your associate-gods—and you do not have to be secretive about your plot—then carry it out against me without delay!",
        "And if you turn away, ˹remember˺ I have never demanded a reward from you ˹for delivering the message˺. My reward is only from Allah. And I have been commanded to be one of those who submit ˹to Allah˺.”",
        "But they still rejected him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark and made them successors, and drowned those who rejected Our signs. See then what was the end of those who had been warned!",
        "Then after him We sent ˹other˺ messengers to their ˹own˺ people and they came to them with clear proofs. But they would not believe in what they had rejected before. This is how We seal the hearts of the transgressors.",
        "Then after these ˹messengers˺ We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our signs. But they behaved arrogantly and were a wicked people.",
        "When the truth came to them from Us, they said, “This is certainly pure magic!”",
        "Moses responded, “Is this what you say about the truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? Magicians will never succeed.”",
        "They argued, “Have you come to turn us away from the faith of our forefathers so that the two of you may become supreme in the land? We will never believe in you!”",
        "Pharaoh demanded, “Bring me every skilled magician.”",
        "When the magicians came, Moses said to them, “Cast whatever you wish to cast!”",
        "When they did, Moses said, “What you have produced is mere magic, Allah will surely make it useless, for Allah certainly does not set right the work of the corruptors.",
        "And Allah establishes the truth by His Words—even to the dismay of the wicked.”",
        "But no one believed in Moses except a few youths of his people, while fearing that Pharaoh and their own chiefs might persecute them. And certainly Pharaoh was a tyrant in the land, and he was truly a transgressor.",
        "Moses said, “O my people! If you do believe in Allah and submit ˹to His Will˺, then put your trust in Him.”",
        "They replied, “In Allah we trust. Our Lord! Do not subject us to the persecution of the oppressive people",
        "and deliver us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people.”",
        "We revealed to Moses and his brother, “Appoint houses for your people in Egypt. Turn these houses into places of worship, establish prayer, and give good news to the believers!”",
        "Moses prayed, “Our Lord! You have granted Pharaoh and his chiefs luxuries and riches in this worldly life, ˹which they abused˺ to lead people astray from Your Way! Our Lord, destroy their riches and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment.”",
        "Allah responded ˹to Moses and Aaron˺, “Your prayer is answered! So be steadfast and do not follow the way of those who do not know.”",
        "We brought the Children of Israel across the sea. Then Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them unjustly and oppressively. But as Pharaoh was drowning, he cried out, “I believe that there is no god except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am ˹now˺ one of those who submit.”",
        "˹He was told,˺ “Now ˹you believe˺? But you always disobeyed and were one of the corruptors.",
        "Today We will preserve your corpse so that you may become an example for those who come after you. And surely most people are heedless of Our examples!”",
        "Indeed, We settled the Children of Israel in a blessed land, and granted them good, lawful provisions. They did not differ until knowledge came to them. Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their differences.",
        "If you ˹O Prophet˺ are in doubt about ˹these stories˺ that We have revealed to you, then ask those who read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt",
        "and do not be one of those who deny Allah’s signs or you will be one of the losers.",
        "Indeed, those against whom Allah’s decree ˹of torment˺ is justified will not believe—",
        "even if every sign were to come to them—until they see the painful punishment.",
        "If only there had been a society which believed ˹before seeing the torment˺ and, therefore, benefited from its belief, like the people of Jonah. When they believed, We lifted from them the torment of disgrace in this world and allowed them enjoyment for a while.",
        "Had your Lord so willed ˹O Prophet˺, all ˹people˺ on earth would have certainly believed, every single one of them! Would you then force people to become believers?",
        "It is not for any soul to believe except by Allah’s leave, and He will bring His wrath upon those who are unmindful.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Consider all that is in the heavens and the earth!” Yet neither signs nor warners are of any benefit to those who refuse to believe.",
        "Are they waiting for ˹anything˺ except the same torments that befell those before them? Say, “Keep waiting then! I too am waiting with you.”",
        "Then We saved Our messengers and those who believed. For it is Our duty to save the believers.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! If you are in doubt of my faith, then ˹know that˺ I do not worship those ˹idols˺ you worship instead of Allah. But I worship Allah, Who has the power to cause your death. And I have been commanded, ‘Be one of the believers,’",
        "and, ‘Be steadfast in faith in all uprightness, and do not be one of the polytheists,’",
        "and ‘Do not invoke, instead of Allah, what can neither benefit nor harm you—for if you do, then you will certainly be one of the wrongdoers,’",
        "and ‘If Allah touches you with harm, none can undo it except Him. And if He intends good for you, none can withhold His bounty. He grants it to whoever He wills of His servants. And He is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! The truth has surely come to you from your Lord. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. And I am not a keeper over you.”",
        "And follow what is revealed to you, and be patient until Allah passes His judgment. For He is the Best of Judges."

        "নিশ্চয় তোমাদের রব আল্লাহ। যিনি আসমানসমূহ ও যমীন সৃষ্টি করেছেন ছয় দিনে, তারপর আরশে উঠেছেন। তিনি সব বিষয় পরিচালনা করেন। তার অনুমতি ছাড়া সুপারিশ করার কেউ নেই। তিনিই আল্লাহ, তোমাদের রব। সুতরাং তোমরা তাঁর ইবাদাত কর। তারপরও কি তোমরা উপদেশ গ্রহণ করবে না?",
        "তাঁরই কাছে তোমাদের সকলের প্রত্যাবর্তন। আল্লাহর ওয়াদা সত্য। নিশ্চয় তিনি সৃষ্টির সূচনা করেন। তারপর তার পুনরাবর্তন ঘটান। যারা ঈমান এনেছে এবং সৎকাজ করেছে তাদেরকে ইনসাফপূর্ণ প্রতিদান দেয়ার জন্য। আর যারা কুফরী করেছে, তাদের জন্য রয়েছে উত্তপ্ত পানীয় এবং বেদনাদায়ক আযাব। এ কারণে যে তারা কুফরী করত।",
        "তিনিই সূর্যকে করেছেন দীপ্তিময় এবং চাঁদকে আলোময় আর তার জন্য নির্ধারণ করেছেন বিভিন্ন মনযিল, যাতে তোমরা জানতে পার বছরের গণনা এবং (সময়ের) হিসাব। আল্লাহ এগুলো অবশ্যই যথার্থভাবে সৃষ্টি করেছেন। জ্ঞানী সম্প্রদায়ের জন্য তিনি আয়াতসমূহ বিস্তারিতভাবে বর্ণনা করেন।",

        "নিশ্চয় যারা আমার সাক্ষাতের আশা রাখে না এবং দুনিয়ার জীবন নিয়ে সন্তুষ্ট আছে ও তা নিয়ে পরিতৃপ্ত রয়েছে। আর যারা আমার নিদর্শনাবলী হতে গাফেল ।",

        "আর অবশ্যই আমি তোমাদের পূর্বে বহু প্রজন্মকে ধ্বংস করেছি, যখন তারা যুলম করেছে। আর তাদের নিকট তাদের রাসূলগণ প্রমাণাদিসহ আগমন করেছিল, কিন্তু তারা ঈমান আনার ছিল না। এভাবে আমি অপরাধী কওমকে শাস্তি প্রদান করি।",

        "তিনিই তোমাদেরকে স্থলে ও সমুদ্রে ভ্রমণ করান। এমনকি যখন তোমরা নৌকায় থাক, আর তা তাদেরকে নিয়ে চলতে থাকে অনুকুল হাওয়ায় এবং তারা তা নিয়ে আনন্দিত হয়, (এ সময়) তাকে পেয়ে বসে ঝড়ো হাওয়া, আর চারদিক থেকে ধেয়ে আসে তরঙ্গ এবং তাদের নিশ্চিত ধারণা হয় যে, তাদেরকে পরিবেষ্টন করা হয়েছে। তখন তারা আল্লাহকে ডাকতে থাকে তাঁর জন্য দীনকে একনিষ্ঠ করে, ‘যদি আপনি এ থেকে আমাদেরকে নাজাত দেন, তাহলে আমরা অবশ্যই কৃতজ্ঞদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হব’।",
        "অতঃপর যখন তিনি তাদেরকে নাজাত দেন, তখন তারা অন্যায়ভাবে যমীনে সীমালঙ্ঘন করে। হে মানুষ, তোমাদের সীমালঙ্ঘন তোমাদের বিরুদ্ধেই, এ সব কিছু দুনিয়ার ভোগ। অতঃপর আমার নিকটই তোমাদের প্রত্যাবর্তন। সুতরাং তখন আমি তোমাদেরকে তোমাদের কৃতকর্ম সম্পর্কে জানাব।",
        "নিশ্চয় দুনিয়ার জীবনের তুলনা তো পানির ন্যায় যা আমি আকাশ থেকে নাযিল করি, অতঃপর তার সাথে যমীনের উদ্ভিদের মিশ্রণ ঘটে, যা মানুষ ও চতুষ্পদ জন্তু ভোগ করে। অবশেষে যখন যমীন শোভিত ও সজ্জিত হয় এবং তার অধিবাসীরা মনে করে যমীনে উৎপন্ন ফসল করায়ত্ব করতে তারা সক্ষম, তখন তাতে রাতে কিংবা দিনে আমার আদেশ চলে আসে। অতঃপর আমি সেগুলোকে বানিয়ে দেই কর্তিত ফসল, মনে হয় গতকালও এখানে কিছু ছিল না। এভাবে আমি চিন্তাশীল লোকদের জন্য নিদর্শনসমূহ বিস্তারিতভাবে বর্ণনা করি।",
        "আর আল্লাহ শান্তির আবাসের দিকে আহবান করেন এবং যাকে ইচ্ছা হিদায়াত দেন সরল পথের দিকে।",
        "যারা ভালো কাজ করে তাদের জন্য রয়েছে শুভ পরিণাম (জান্নাত) এবং আরও বেশি। আর ধূলোমলিনতা ও লাঞ্ছনা তাদের চেহারাগুলোকে আচ্ছন্ন করবে না। তারাই জান্নাতবাসী। তারা তাতে স্থায়ী হবে।",
        "আর যারা মন্দ উপার্জন করবে, প্রতিটি মন্দের প্রতিদান হবে তারই অনুরূপ; আর লাঞ্ছনা তাদেরকে আচ্ছন্ন করবে। আল্লাহর পাকড়াও থেকে তাদের কোন রক্ষাকারী নেই। যেন অন্ধকার রাতের এক অংশ দিয়ে তাদের চেহারাগুলো ঢেকে দেয়া হয়েছে। তারাই আগুনের অধিবাসী, তারা তাতে স্থায়ী হবে।",
        "আর যেদিন আমি তাদের সকলকে একত্র করব, অতঃপর যারা শিরক করেছে, তাদেরকে বলব, ‘থাম, তোমরা ও তোমাদের শরীকরা’। অতঃপর আমি তাদের মধ্যে বিচ্ছেদ ঘটাব। আর তাদের শরীকরা’ বলবে, ‘তোমরা তো আমাদের ইবাদাত করতে না’।",
        "‘সুতরাং আল্লাহই আমাদের ও তোমাদের মধ্যে সাক্ষী হিসেবে যথেষ্ট। আমরা নিশ্চয় তোমাদের ইবাদাত সম্পর্কে গাফেল ছিলাম’।",
        "এখানে প্রত্যেকে ইতিপূর্বে যা করেছে, সে সম্পর্কে জানতে পারবে। আর তাদেরকে তাদের প্রকৃত অভিভাবক আল্লাহর কাছে ফিরিয়ে দেয়া হবে এবং তারা যা মিথ্যা রটাতো তা তাদের থেকে হারিয়ে যাবে।",
        "বল, ‘আসমান ও যমীন থেকে কে তোমাদের রিয্ক দেন? অথবা কে (তোমাদের) শ্রবণ ও দৃষ্টিসমূহের মালিক? আর কে মৃত থেকে জীবিতকে বের করেন আর জীবিত থেকে মৃতকে বের করেন? কে সব বিষয় পরিচালনা করেন’? তখন তারা অবশ্যই বলবে, ‘আল্লাহ’। সুতরাং, তুমি বল, ‘তারপরও কি তোমরা তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করবে না’?",
        "অতএব, তিনিই আল্লাহ, তোমাদের প্রকৃত রব। অতঃপর সত্যের পর ভ্রষ্টতা ছাড়া কী থাকে? অতএব কোথায় তোমাদেরকে ঘুরানো হচ্ছে?",
        "এমনিভাবে তোমার রবের বাণী সত্য বলে সাব্যস্ত হয়েছে তাদের উপর, যারা অবাধ্য হয়েছে, যে তারা ঈমান আনবে না।",
        "বল, ‘তোমাদের শরীকদের কেউ কি আছে, যে প্রথম সৃষ্টি করবে, অতঃপর তার পুনরাবৃত্তি ঘটাবে’? বল, ‘আল্লাহই প্রথম সৃষ্টি করেন অতঃপর তার পুনরাবৃত্তি ঘটান’। অতএব তোমাদেরকে কোথায় ফিরানো হচ্ছে?",
        "বল, ‘তোমাদের শরীকদের কেউ কি আছে, যে সত্যের পথ দেখাবে’? বল, ‘আল্লাহই সত্যের পথ দেখান। যিনি সত্যের পথ দেখান, তিনিই কি অনুসরণ করার অধিক হকদার, নাকি সে, যে পথ দেখানো ছাড়া পথ পায় না। সুতরাং তোমাদের কী হল? তোমরা কেমন বিচার করছ’।",
        "আর তাদের অধিকাংশ কেবল ধারণার অনুসরণ করে। নিশ্চয় সত্যের বিপরীতে ধারণা কোন কার্যকারিতা রাখে না । নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ তারা যা করে সে সম্পর্কে সম্যক অবগত।",
        "এ কুরআন তো এমন নয় যে, আল্লাহ ছাড়া কেউ তা রচনা করতে পারবে; বরং এটি যা তার সামনে রয়েছে, তার সত্যায়ন এবং কিতাবের বিস্তারিত ব্যাখ্যা, যাতে কোন সন্দেহ নেই, যা সৃষ্টিকুলের রবের পক্ষ থেকে।",
        "নাকি তারা বলে, ‘সে তা বানিয়েছে’? বল, ‘তবে তোমরা তার মত একটি সূরা (বানিয়ে) নিয়ে আস এবং আল্লাহ ছাড়া যাকে পারো ডাক, যদি তোমরা সত্যবাদী হও’।",
        "বরং তারা যে ব্যাপারে পূর্ণ জ্ঞান লাভ করেনি, তা তারা অস্বীকার করেছে এবং এখনও তার পরিণতি তাদের কাছে আসেনি। এভাবেই তারা অস্বীকার করেছিল, যারা ছিল তাদের পূর্বে। সুতরাং তুমি লক্ষ্য কর, কেমন ছিল যালিমদের পরিণাম।",
        "আর তাদের মধ্যে কেউ এর প্রতি ঈমান আনে এবং কেউ তাতে ঈমান আনে না। আর তোমার রব ফাসাদকারীদের ব্যাপারে অধিক জ্ঞাত।",
        "আর তারা যদি তোমাকে মিথ্যাবাদী বলে, তবে তুমি বল, ‘আমার কর্ম আমার, আর তোমাদের কর্ম তোমাদের। আমি যা আমল করি তোমরা তা থেকে মুক্ত এবং তোমরা যা আমল কর আমি তা থেকে মুক্ত’।",
        "আর তাদের মধ্যে কিছু আছে, যারা তোমার প্রতি মনোযোগ দিয়ে শুনে। তবে কি তুমি বধিরকে শোনাবে, তারা না বুঝলেও?",
        "আর তাদের মধ্যে কেউ আছে এমন, যে তোমার দিকে তাকায়। তবে কি তুমি অন্ধকে পথ দেখাবে, তারা না দেখলেও?",
        "নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ মানুষের প্রতি কিছুমাত্র যুলম করেন না; বরং মানুষই নিজদের উপর যুলম করে।",
        "আর যেদিন তিনি তাদেরকে একত্র করবেন, যেন তারা দিবসের মুহূর্তকালমাত্র অবস্থান করেছে। তারা একে অপরকে চিনতে পারবে। তারা অবশ্যই ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত হয়েছে, যারা আল্লাহর সাক্ষাৎ অস্বীকার করেছে, আর তারা হিদায়াতপ্রাপ্ত ছিল না।",
        "আর আমি তাদেরকে যে প্রতিশ্রুতি দিয়েছি, তার কিছু যদি তোমাকে দেখিয়ে দেই, অথবা তোমাকে মৃত্যু দেই, তবে আমার কাছেই তাদের প্রত্যাবর্তন। তারপর তারা যা করে আল্লাহ তার সাক্ষী।",
        "আর প্রত্যেক উম্মতের জন্য রয়েছে রাসূল। তারপর যখন তাদের রাসূল আসে, তাদের মধ্যে তখন ন্যায়ভিত্তিক ফয়সালা করা হয় এবং তাদের যুলম করা হয় না।",
        "আর তারা বলে, ‘কখন এই প্রতিশ্রুতি (পূর্ণ হবে), যদি তোমরা সত্যবাদী হও’?",
        "বল, ‘আমি নিজের ক্ষতি বা উপকারের অধিকার রাখি না, তবে আল্লাহ যা ইচ্ছা করেন’। প্রত্যেক উম্মতের রয়েছে নির্দিষ্ট একটি সময়। যখন এসে যায় তাদের সময়, তখন এক মুহূর্ত পিছাতে পারে না এবং এগোতেও পারে না।",
        "বল, ‘তোমাদের কি মনে হয় যে, যদি তোমাদের নিকট তাঁর আযাব রাতে কিংবা দিনে এসে পড়ে, তবে অপরাধীরা তার কোন্ অংশটি তাড়াতাড়ি চায়’?",
        "তবে কি যখন তা ঘটবে, তখন তোমরা তাতে ঈমান আনবে? এখন? অথচ তোমরা এর জন্যই তাড়াহুড়া করতে।",
        "তারপর যারা যুলম করেছে তাদের বলা হবে, স্থায়ী আযাব আস্বাদন কর। তোমরা যা অর্জন করতে তোমাদেরকে কেবল তারই প্রতিদান দেয়া হচ্ছে।",
        "আর তারা তোমার কাছে জানতে চায়, ‘তা কি সত্য’? বল, ‘হ্যাঁ, আমার রবের কসম! নিশ্চয় তা সত্য এবং তোমরা পরাস্তকারী নও’।",
        "আর যমীনে যা রয়েছে, তা যদি যুলম করেছে এমন প্রত্যেক ব্যক্তির হয়ে যায়, তবে তা সে মুক্তিপণ হিসেবে দিয়ে দেবে এবং তারা লজ্জা গোপন করবে, যখন তারা আযাব দেখবে। আর তাদের মধ্যে ন্যায়ভিত্তিক ফয়সালা করা হবে এবং তাদেরকে যুলম করা হবে না।",
        "জেনে রাখ, নিশ্চয় আসমানসমূহ ও যমীনে যা আছে, তা আল্লাহরই। জেনে রাখ, নিশ্চয় আল্লাহর ওয়াদা সত্য, কিন্তু তাদের অধিকাংশই জানে না।",
        "তিনিই জীবন দান করেন এবং মৃত্যু ঘটান এবং তাঁর কাছেই তোমাদের প্রত্যাবর্তন হবে।",
        "হে মানুষ, তোমাদের রবের পক্ষ থেকে তোমাদের কাছে এসেছে উপদেশ এবং অন্তরসমূহে যা থাকে তার শিফা, আর মুমিনদের জন্য হিদায়াত ও রহমত।",
        "বল, ‘আল্লাহর অনুগ্রহ ও রহমতে। সুতরাং এ নিয়েই যেন তারা খুশি হয়’। এটি যা তারা জমা করে তা থেকে উত্তম।",
        "বল, ‘তোমরা কি ভেবে দেখেছ, আল্লাহ তোমাদের জন্য যে রিয্ক নাযিল করেছেন, পরে তোমরা তার কিছু বানিয়েছ হারাম ও হালাল’। বল, ‘আল্লাহ কি তোমাদেরকে অনুমতি দিয়েছেন, নাকি আল্লাহর উপর তোমরা মিথ্যা রটাচ্ছ’?",
        "আর যারা আল্লাহর নামে মিথ্যা রটাচ্ছে, তাদের কী ধারণা, কিয়ামতের দিন (তাদের পরিণতি) সম্পর্কে? নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ মানুষের উপর অনুগ্রহশীল; কিন্তু তাদের অধিকাংশ শোকর করে না।",
        "আর তুমি যে অবস্থাতেই থাক না কেন আর যা কিছু তিলাওয়াত কর না কেন আল্লাহর পক্ষ হতে কুরআন থেকে এবং তোমরা যে আমলই কর না কেন, আমি তোমাদের উপর সাক্ষী থাকি, যখন তোমরা তাতে নিমগ্ন হও। তোমার রব থেকে গোপন থাকে না যমীনের বা আসমানের অণু পরিমাণ কিছুই এবং তা থেকে ছোট বা বড়, তবে (এর সব কিছুই) রয়েছে সুস্পষ্ট কিতাবে।",
        "শুনে রাখ, নিশ্চয় আল্লাহর বন্ধুদের কোন ভয় নেই, আর তারা পেরেশানও হবে না।",
        "যারা ঈমান এনেছে এবং তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করত।",
        "তাদের জন্যই সুসংবাদ দুনিয়াবী জীবনে এবং আখিরাতে। আল্লাহর বাণীসমূহের কোন পরিবর্তন নেই। এটিই মহাসফলতা।",
        "আর তাদের কথা যেন তোমাকে দুঃখ না দেয়। নিশ্চয় সকল মর্যাদা আল্লাহর। তিনি সর্বশ্রোতা, সর্বজ্ঞানী।",
        "জেনে রাখ, নিশ্চয় আসমানসমূহে যারা আছে এবং যমীনে যারা আছে সব আল্লাহরই এবং যারা আল্লাহ ছাড়া অন্যদের ডাকে, তারা মূলত শরীকদের অনুসরণ করে না, তারা তো কেবল ধারণার অনুসরণ করে। তারা তো শুধু মিথ্যাই বলে।",
        "তিনিই সে সত্তা, যিনি তোমাদের জন্য রাতকে সৃষ্টি করেছেন, যেন তোমরা তাতে বিশ্রাম নাও এবং দিনকে করেছেন আলোকময়। নিশ্চয় এতে রয়েছে নিদর্শনাবলি এমন কওমের জন্য যারা শুনে।",
        "তারা বলে, ‘আল্লাহ সন্তান গ্রহণ করেছেন’। তিনি পবিত্র মহান। তিনি অমুখাপেক্ষী। আসমানসমূহ ও যমীনে যা রয়েছে তা তাঁরই। তোমাদের কাছে এ ব্যাপারে কোন প্রমাণ নেই। তোমরা কি আল্লাহর উপর এমন কিছু বলছ, যা তোমরা জান না?",

        "(তাদের জন্য) দুনিয়াতে রয়েছে ভোগসামগ্রী। অতঃপর আমারই কাছে তাদের প্রত্যাবর্তন। তারপর আমি তাদেরকে কঠিন আযাব আস্বাদন করাব, তারা যে কুফরী করত তার কারণে ।",
        "আর তাদেরকে নূহের সংবাদ পড়ে শুনাও, যখন সে তার কওমকে বলল, ‘হে আমার কওম, আমার অবস্থান এবং আল্লাহর আয়াতসমূহের মাধ্যমে আমার উপদেশ দান যদি তোমাদের কাছে ভারী মনে হয়, তবে আমি আল্লাহর উপরই তাওয়াক্কুল করলাম। সুতরাং তোমরা অভিন্ন সিদ্ধান্ত গ্রহণ কর এবং (সাথে নাও) তোমাদের শরীকদের। তারপর তোমাদের বিষয়টি যেন তোমাদের নিকট অস্পষ্ট না থাকে। এরপর আমার ব্যাপারে সিদ্ধান্ত চূড়ান্ত কর এবং আমাকে অবকাশ দিও না’।",

        "অতঃপর তারা তাকে মিথ্যাবাদী বলল। তাই আমি তাকে ও নৌকাতে যারা তার সাথে ছিল তাদেরকে নাজাত দিলাম এবং আমি তাদেরকে করেছি স্থলাভিষিক্ত। আর ডুবিয়ে দিলাম তাদেরকে, যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহকে অস্বীকার করেছে। অতএব দেখ, কেমন ছিল তাদের পরিণতি যাদেরকে সতর্ক করা হয়েছে।",
        "অতঃপর আমি তাঁর পরে অনেক রাসূলকে তাদের কওমের নিকট পাঠিয়েছি এবং তারা তাদের নিকট সুস্পষ্ট প্রমাণাদি নিয়ে এসেছিল; কিন্তু তারা ইতঃপূর্বে অস্বীকার করার কারণে ঈমান আনার ছিল না। এমনিভাবে আমি সীমালঙ্ঘনকারীদের অন্তরে মোহর এঁটে দেই।",
        "অতঃপর তাদের পরে আমি মূসা ও হারূনকে ফিরআউন ও তার পারিষদবর্গের কাছে আমার আয়াতসমূহ দিয়ে পাঠিয়েছি। কিন্তু তারা অহঙ্কার করেছে। আর তারা ছিল অপরাধী কওম।",
        "অতঃপর যখন তাদের কাছে আমার পক্ষ থেকে সত্য এল, তারা বলল, ‘নিশ্চয় এটি সুস্পষ্ট যাদু’।",
        "মূসা বলল, ‘তোমরা কি সত্যকে এ রকম (যাদু) বলছ, যখন তা তোমাদের কাছে এল? এ কি যাদু? অথচ যাদুকররা সফল হয় না’।",
        "তারা বলল, ‘তুমি কি এসেছ আমরা আমাদের পিতৃপুরুষদেরকে যাতে পেয়েছি তা থেকে আমাদেরকে ফেরাতে এবং যেন যমীনে তোমাদের প্রতিপত্তি প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয়? আর আমরা তো তোমাদের প্রতি বিশ্বাসী নই’।",
        "এবং ফির‘আউন বলল, ‘তোমরা প্রত্যেক বিজ্ঞ যাদুকরদেরকে আমার কাছে নিয়ে আস’।",
        "অতঃপর যখন যাদুকররা এল, মূসা তাদেরকে বলল, ‘তোমরা যা ফেলবার ফেল’।",
        "অতঃপর যখন তারা (তাদের রশি ও লাঠি) ফেলল, তখন মূসা বলল, ‘তোমরা যা আনলে, তা যাদু। নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ তা বাতিল করে দেবেন। নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ ফাসাদকারীদের আমল পরিশুদ্ধ করেন না’।",
        "আর আল্লাহ তাঁর বাণীসমূহের মাধ্যমে সত্যকে প্রতিষ্ঠিত করেন, যদিও অপরাধীরা তা অপছন্দ করে।",
        "বস্তুতঃ মূসার প্রতি তার স্বগোত্রীয় লোকদের মধ্যে (প্রথমে) শুধু অল্প সংখ্যক লোকই ঈমান আনল, তাও ফির‘আউন ও তার প্রধানবর্গের এই ভয়ে যে, তারা তাদেরকে নির্যাতন করে; আর বাস্তবিক পক্ষে ফির‘আউন সেই দেশে (রাজ্য) ক্ষমতা রাখত, আর এটাও ছিল যে, সে (ন্যায়ের) সীমাতিক্রম করে ফেলতো।",
        "আর মূসা বলল, ‘হে আমার কওম, তোমরা যদি আল্লাহর প্রতি ঈমান এনে থাক, তবে তাঁরই উপর তাওয়াক্কুল কর, যদি তোমরা মুসলিম হয়ে থাক’।",
        "তখন তারা বলল, ‘আমরা আল্লাহর উপরই তাওয়াক্কুল করলাম। হে আমাদের রব, আপনি আমাদেরকে যালিম কওমের ফিতনার পাত্র বানাবেন না’।",
        "‘আর আমাদেরকে আপনার অনুগ্রহে কাফির কওম থেকে নাজাত দিন’।",
        "আর আমি মূসা ও তার ভাইয়ের কাছে ওহী পাঠালাম যে, ‘তোমরা তোমাদের কওমের জন্য মিসরে গৃহ তৈরী কর এবং তোমাদের গৃহগুলোকে কিবলা বানাও আর সালাত কায়েম কর এবং মুমিনদের সুসংবাদ দাও’।",
        "আর মূসা বলল, ‘হে আমাদের রব, আপনি ফির‘আউন ও তার পারিষদবর্গকে দুনিয়াবী জীবনে সৌন্দর্য ও ধন-সম্পদ দান করেছেন। হে আমাদের রব, যাতে তারা আপনার পথ থেকে গোমরাহ করতে পারে। হে আমাদের রব, তাদের ধন-সম্পদ নিশ্চি‎হ্ন করে দিন, তাদের অন্তরসমূহকে কঠোর করে দিন। ফলে তারা ঈমান আনবে না, যতক্ষণ না যন্ত্রণাদায়ক আযাব দেখে’।",
        "তিনি বললেন, ‘তোমাদের দো‘আ কবূল করা হয়েছে। সুতরাং তোমরা দৃঢ় থাক এবং যারা জানে না তাদের পথ অনুসরণ করো না’।",
        "আর আমি বনী ইসরাঈলকে সমুদ্র পার করিয়ে নিলাম। আর ফির‘আউন ও তার সৈন্যবাহিনী ঔদ্ধত্য প্রকাশ ও সীমালঙ্ঘনকারী হয়ে তাদের পিছু নিল। অবশেষে যখন সে ডুবে যেতে লাগল, তখন বলল, ‘আমি ঈমান এনেছি যে, সে সত্তা ছাড়া কোন ইলাহ নেই, যার প্রতি বনী ইসরাঈল ঈমান এনেছে। আর আমি মুসলিমদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত’।",
        "‘এখন অথচ ইতঃপূর্বে তুমি নাফরমানী করেছ, আর তুমি ছিলে ফাসাদকারীদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত’।",
        "‘সুতরাং আজ আমি তোমার দেহটি রক্ষা করব, যাতে তুমি তোমার পরবর্তীদের জন্য নিদর্শন হয়ে থাক। আর নিশ্চয় অনেক মানুষ আমার নিদর্শনসমূহের ব্যাপারে গাফেল’।",
        "আর অবশ্যই আমি বনী ইসরাঈলকে উত্তম বাসভূমিতে আবাস দিলাম এবং তাদেরকে উত্তম রিয্ক দিলাম। অতঃপর তারা মতবিরোধ করেনি, যতক্ষণ না তাদের নিকট জ্ঞান এল। নিশ্চয় তোমার রব কিয়ামতের দিন সে বিষয়ে ফয়সালা করবেন যা নিয়ে তারা মতবিরোধ করত।",
        "সুতরাং আমি তোমার নিকট যা নাযিল করেছি, তা নিয়ে তুমি যদি সন্দেহে থাক, তাহলে যারা তোমার পূর্ব থেকেই কিতাব পাঠ করছে তাদেরকে জিজ্ঞাসা কর। অবশ্যই তোমার নিকট তোমার রবের পক্ষ থেকে সত্য এসেছে। সুতরাং তুমি সন্দেহ পোষণকারীদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হয়ো না।",
        "আর তুমি তাদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হয়ো না, যারা আল্লাহর আয়াতসমূহ অস্বীকার করেছে। তাহলে তুমি ক্ষতিগ্রস্তদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হবে।",
        "নিশ্চয় যাদের উপর তোমার রবের বাণী সত্য হয়েছে, তারা ঈমান আনবে না;",

        "সুতরাং কেন হল না এমন এক জনপদ, যে ঈমান এনেছে এবং তার ঈমান তার উপকারে এসেছে? তবে ইউনুসের কওম ছাড়া যখন তারা ঈমান আনল, তখন আমি তাদের থেকে দুনিয়ার জীবনের লাঞ্ছনাকর আযাব সরিয়ে দিলাম এবং আমি তাদেরকে একটি সময় পর্যন্ত ভোগ করতে দিলাম।",
        "আর যদি তোমার রব চাইতেন, তবে যমীনের সকলেই ঈমান আনত। তবে কি তুমি মানুষকে বাধ্য করবে, যাতে তারা মুমিন হয় ?",
        "আর কারও পক্ষে সম্ভব নয় যে, আললাহর অনুমতি ছাড়া ঈমান আনবে এবং যারা বুঝে না তিনি আযাব চাপিয়ে দেবেন তাদের উপর।",
        "বল, ‘আসমানসমূহ ও যমীনে কী আছে তা তাকিয়ে দেখ। আর নিদর্শনসমূহ ও সতর্ককারীগণ এমন কওমের কাজে আসে না, যারা ঈমান আনে না’।",
        "তবে কি তারা কেবল তাদের পূর্বে বিগত লোকদের অনুরূপ দিনগুলোরই অপেক্ষা করছে? বল, ‘তবে তোমরা অপেক্ষা কর, আমিও তোমাদের সাথে অপেক্ষমান’।",
        "তারপর আমি নাজাত দেই আমার রাসূলদেরকে এবং তাদেরকেও যারা ঈমান এনেছে। এটা আমার দায়িত্ব যে, মুমিনদের নাজাত দেই।",
        "বল, ‘হে মানুষ, তোমরা যদি আমার দীনের ব্যাপারে সন্দেহে থাক, তবে আল্লাহ ছাড়া তোমরা যার ইবাদাত কর আমি তার ইবাদাত করি না, বরং আমি ইবাদাত করি আল্লাহর, যিনি তোমাদের মৃত্যু দেন। আর আমি আদিষ্ট হয়েছি মুমিনদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হওয়ার’।",
        "আর (এ নির্দেশ) যে, ‘তুমি নিজেকে দীনের উপর প্রতিষ্ঠিত রাখ একনিষ্ঠভাবে এবং মুশরিকদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হয়ো না’।",
        "‘আর আল্লাহ ছাড়া এমন কিছুকে ডেকো না, যা তোমার উপকার করতে পারে না এবং তোমার ক্ষতিও করতে পারে না। অতএব তুমি যদি কর, তাহলে নিশ্চয় তুমি যালিমদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হবে।",
        "‘আর আল্লাহ যদি তোমাকে কোন ক্ষতি পৌঁছান, তবে তিনি ছাড়া তা দূর করার কেউ নেই। আর তিনি যদি তোমার কল্যাণ চান, তবে তাঁর অনুগ্রহের কোন প্রতিরোধকারী নেই। তিনি তার বান্দাদের যাকে ইচ্ছা তাকে তা দেন। আর তিনি পরম ক্ষমাশীল, অতি দয়ালু’।",
        "বল, ‘হে মানুষ’, তোমাদের রবের পক্ষ থেকে তোমাদের নিকট সত্য এসেছে। সুতরাং যে হিদায়াত গ্রহণ করবে, সে নিজের জন্যই হিদায়াত গ্রহণ করবে। আর যে পথভ্রষ্ট হবে, সে নিজের ক্ষতির জন্য পথভ্রষ্ট হবে। আর আমি তোমাদের অভিভাবক নই।",
        "আর তোমার নিকট যে ওহী পাঠানো হচ্ছে, তুমি তার অনুসরণ কর এবং সবর কর, যতক্ষণ না আল্লাহ ফয়সালা করেন। আর তিনিই উত্তম ফয়সালাকারী।"

        "کیا لوگوں کو تعجب ہوا کہ ہم نے ان ہی میں سے ایک مرد کو حکم بھیجا کہ لوگوں کو ڈر سنا دو۔ اور ایمان لانے والوں کو خوشخبری دے دو کہ ان کے پروردگار کے ہاں ان کا سچا درجہ ہے۔ (ایسے شخص کی نسبت) کافر کہتے ہیں کہ یہ صریح جادوگر ہے",
        "تمہارا پروردگار تو خدا ہی ہے جس نے آسمان اور زمین چھ دن میں بنائے پھر عرش (تخت شاہی) پر قائم ہوا وہی ہر ایک کا انتظام کرتا ہے۔ کوئی (اس کے پاس) اس کا اذن حاصل کیے بغیر کسی کی سفارش نہیں کرسکتا، یہی خدا تمہارا پروردگار ہے تو اسی کی عبادت کرو۔ بھلا تم غور کیوں نہیں کرتے",
        "اسی کے پاس تم سب کو لوٹ کر جانا ہے۔ خدا کا وعدہ سچا ہے۔ وہی خلقت کو پہلی بار پیدا کرتا ہے۔ پھر وہی اس کو دوبارہ پیدا کرے گا تاکہ ایمان والوں اور نیک کام کرنے والوں کو انصاف کے ساتھ بدلہ دے۔ اور جو کافر ہیں ان کے لیے پینے کو نہایت گرم پانی اور درد دینے والا عذاب ہوگا کیوں کہ (خدا سے) انکار کرتے تھے",
        "وہی تو ہے جس نے سورج کو روشن اور چاند کو منور بنایا اور چاند کی منزلیں مقرر کیں تاکہ تم برسوں کا شمار اور (کاموں کا) حساب معلوم کرو۔ یہ (سب کچھ) خدا نے تدبیر سے پیدا کیا ہے۔ سمجھنے والوں کے لیے وہ اپنی آیاتیں کھول کھول کر بیان فرماتا ہے",
        "رات اور دن کے (ایک دوسرے کے پیچھے) آنے جانے میں اور جو چیزیں خدا نے آسمان اور زمین میں پیدا کی ہیں (سب میں) ڈرنے والوں کے لیے نشانیاں ہیں",
        "جن لوگوں کو ہم سے ملنے کی توقع نہیں اور دنیا کی زندگی سے خوش اور اسی پر مطئمن ہو بیٹھے اور ہماری نشانیوں سے غافل ہو رہے ہیں",
        "ان کا ٹھکانہ ان (اعمال) کے سبب جو وہ کرتے ہیں دوزخ ہے",
        "اور جو لوگ ایمان لائے اور نیک کام کرتے رہے ان کو پروردگار ان کے ایمان کی وجہ سے (ایسے محلوں کی) راہ دکھائے گا (کہ) ان کے نیچے نعمت کے باغوں میں نہریں بہہ رہی ہوں گی",
        "(جب وہ) ان میں (ان نعمتوں کو دیکھوں گے تو بےساختہ) کہیں گے سبحان الله۔ اور آپس میں ان کی دعا سلامٌ علیکم ہوگی اور ان کا آخری قول یہ (ہوگا) کہ خدائے رب العالمین کی حمد (اور اس کا شکر) ہے",
        "اور اگر خدا لوگوں کی برائی میں جلدی کرتا جس طرح وہ طلب خیر میں جلدی کرتے ہیں۔ تو ان کی (عمر کی) میعاد پوری ہوچکی ہوتی سو جن لوگوں کو ہم سے ملنے کی توقع نہیں انہیں ہم چھوڑے رکھتے ہیں کہ اپنی سرکشی میں بہکتے رہیں",
        "اور جب انسان کو تکلیف پہنچتی ہے تو لیٹا اور بیٹھا اور کھڑا (ہر حال میں) ہمیں پکارتا ہے۔ پھر جب ہم اس تکلیف کو اس سے دور کر دیتے ہیں تو (بےلحاظ ہو جاتا ہے اور) اس طرح گزر جاتا ہے گویا کسی تکلیف پہنچنے پر ہمیں کبھی پکارا ہی نہ تھا۔ اسی طرح حد سے نکل جانے والوں کو ان کے اعمال آراستہ کرکے دکھائے گئے ہیں",
        "اور تم سے پہلے ہم کئی امتوں کو جب انہوں نے ظلم کا راستہ اختیار کیا ہلاک کرچکے ہیں۔ اور ان کے پاس پیغمبر کھلی نشانیاں لے کر آئے مگر وہ ایسے نہ تھے کہ ایمان لاتے۔ ہم گنہگار لوگوں کو اسی طرح بدلہ دیا کرتے ہیں",

        "دنیا کی زندگی کی مثال مینھہ کی سی ہے کہ ہم نے اس کو آسمان سے برسایا۔ پھر اس کے ساتھ سبزہ جسے آدمی اور جانور کھاتے ہیں مل کر نکلا یہاں تک کہ زمین سبزے سے خوشنما اور آراستہ ہوگئی اور زمین والوں نے خیال کیا کہ وہ اس پر پوری دسترس رکھتے ہیں ناگہاں رات کو یا دن کو ہمارا حکم (عذاب) آپہنچا تو ہم نے اس کو کاٹ (کر ایسا کر) ڈالا کہ گویا کل وہاں کچھ تھا ہی نہیں۔ جو لوگ غور کرنے والے ہیں۔ ان کے لیے ہم (اپنی قدرت کی) نشانیاں اسی طرح کھول کھول کر بیان کرتے ہیں",

        "اور جس دن ہم ان سب کو جمع کریں گے پھر مشرکوں سے کہیں گے کہ تم اور تمہارے شریک اپنی اپنی جگہ ٹھہرے رہو۔ تو ہم ان میں تفرقہ ڈال دیں گے اور ان کے شریک (ان سے) کہیں گے کہ تم ہم کو نہیں پوجا کرتے تھے",
        "ہمارے اور تمہارے درمیان خدا ہی گواہ کافی ہے۔ ہم تمہاری پرستش سے بالکل بےخبر تھے",

        "یہی خدا تو تمہارا پروردگار برحق ہے۔ اور حق بات کے ظاہر ہونے کے بعد گمراہی کے سوا ہے ہی کیا؟ تو تم کہاں پھرے جاتے ہو",
        "اسی طرح خدا کا ارشاد ان نافرمانوں کے حق میں ثابت ہو کر رہا کہ یہ ایمان نہیں لائیں گے",
        "(ان سے) پوچھو کہ بھلا تمھارے شریکوں میں سے کوئی ایسا ہے کہ مخلوق کو ابتداً پیدا کرے (اور) پھر اس کو دوبارہ بنائے؟ کہہ دو کہ خدا ہی پہلی بار پیدا کرتا ہے پھر وہی اس کو دوبارہ پیدا کرے گا تو تم کہاں اُکسے جارہے ہو",
        "پوچھو کہ بھلا تمہارے شریکوں میں کون ایسا ہے کہ حق کا رستہ دکھائے۔ کہہ دو کہ خدا ہی حق کا رستہ دکھاتا ہے۔ بھلا جو حق کا رستہ دکھائے وہ اس قابل ہے کہ اُس کی پیروی کی جائے یا وہ کہ جب تک کوئی اسے رستہ نہ بتائے رستہ نہ پائے۔ تو تم کو کیا ہوا ہے کیسا انصاف کرتے ہو؟",
        "اور ان میں سے اکثر صرف ظن کی پیروی کرتے ہیں۔ اور کچھ شک نہیں کہ ظن حق کے مقابلے میں کچھ بھی کارآمد نہیں ہوسکتا۔ بےشک خدا تمہارے (سب) افعال سے واقف ہے",
        "اور یہ قرآن ایسا نہیں کہ خدا کے سوا کوئی اس کو اپنی طرف سے بنا لائے۔ ہاں (ہاں یہ خدا کا کلام ہے) جو (کتابیں) اس سے پہلے (کی) ہیں۔ ان کی تصدیق کرتا ہے اور ان ہی کتابوں کی (اس میں) تفصیل ہے اس میں کچھ شک نہیں (کہ) یہ رب العالمین کی طرف سے (نازل ہوا) ہے",
        "کیا یہ لوگ کہتے ہیں کہ پیغمبر نے اس کو اپنی طرف سے بنا لیا ہے کہہ دو کہ اگر سچے ہو تو تم بھی اس طرح کی ایک سورت بنا لاؤ اور خدا کے سوا جن کو تم بلا سکو بلا بھی لو",
        "حقیقت یہ ہے کہ جس چیز کے علم پر یہ قابو نہیں پاسکے اس کو (نادانی سے) جھٹلا دیا اور ابھی اس کی حقیقت ان پر کھلی ہی نہیں۔ اسی طرح جو لوگ ان سے پہلے تھے انہوں نے تکذیب کی تھی سو دیکھ لو ظالموں کا انجام کیسا ہوا",
        "اور ان میں سے کچھ تو ایسے ہیں کہ اس پر ایمان لے آتے ہیں اور کچھ ایسے ہیں کہ ایمان نہیں لاتے۔ اور تمھارا پروردگار شریروں سے خوب واقف ہے",
        "اور اگر یہ تمہاری تکذیب کریں تو کہہ دو کہ مجھ کو میرے اعمال (کا بدلہ ملے گا) اور تم کو تمہارے اعمال (کا) تم میرے عملوں کا جواب دہ نہیں ہو اور میں تمہارے عملوں کا جوابدہ نہیں ہوں",
        "اور ان میں سے بعض ایسے ہیں کہ تمہاری طرف کان لگاتے ہیں تو کیا تم بہروں کو سناؤ گے اگرچہ کچھ بھی (سنتے) سمجھتے نہ ہوں",
        "اور بعض ایسے ہیں کہ تمھاری طرف دیکھتے ہیں۔ تو کیا تم اندھوں کو راستہ دکھاؤ گے اگرچہ کچھ بھی دیکھتے (بھالتے) نہ ہوں",
        "خدا تو لوگوں پر کچھ ظلم نہیں کرتا لیکن لوگ ہی اپنے آپ پر ظلم کرتے ہیں",
        "اور جس دن خدا ان کو جمع کرے گا (تو وہ دنیا کی نسبت ایسا خیال کریں گے کہ) گویا (وہاں) گھڑی بھر دن سے زیادہ رہے ہی نہیں تھے (اور) آپس میں ایک دوسرے کو شناخت بھی کریں گے۔ جن لوگوں نے خدا کے روبرو حاضر ہونے کو جھٹلایا وہ خسارے میں پڑ گئے اور راہ یاب نہ ہوئے",
        "اور اگر ہم کوئی عذاب جس کا ان لوگوں سے وعدہ کرتے ہیں تمہاری آنکھوں کے سامنے (نازل) کریں یا (اس وقت جب) تمہاری مدت حیات پوری کردیں تو ان کو ہمارے ہی پاس لوٹ کر آنا ہے پھر جو کچھ یہ کر رہے ہیں خدا اس کو دیکھ رہا ہے",
        "اور ہر ایک اُمت کی طرف سے پیغمبر بھیجا گیا۔ جب ان کا پیغمبر آتا ہے تو اُن میں انصاف کے ساتھ فیصلہ کر دیا جاتا ہے اور ان پر کچھ ظلم نہیں کیا جاتا",
        "اور یہ کہتے ہیں کہ اگر تم سچے ہو تو (جس عذاب کا) یہ وعدہ (ہے وہ آئے گا) کب؟",
        "کہہ دو کہ میں اپنے نقصان اور فائدے کا بھی کچھ اختیار نہیں رکھتا۔ مگر جو خدا چاہے۔ ہر ایک امت کے لیے (موت کا) ایک وقت مقرر ہے۔ جب وہ وقت آجاتا ہے تو ایک گھڑی بھی دیر نہیں کرسکتے اور نہ جلدی کرسکتے ہیں",
        "کہہ دو کہ بھلا دیکھو تو اگر اس کا عذاب تم پر (ناگہاں) آجائے رات کو یا دن کو تو پھر گنہگار کس بات کی جلدی کریں گے",
        "کیا جب وہ آ واقع ہوگا تب اس پر ایمان لاؤ گے (اس وقت کہا جائے گا کہ) اور اب (ایمان لائے؟) اس کے لیے تو تم جلدی مچایا کرتے تھے",
        "پھر ظالم لوگوں سے کہا جائے گا کہ عذاب دائمی کا مزہ چکھو۔ (اب) تم انہیں (اعمال) کا بدلہ پاؤ گے جو (دنیا میں) کرتے رہے",
        "اور تم سے دریافت کرتے ہیں کہ آیا یہ سچ ہے۔ کہہ دو ہاں خدا کی قسم سچ ہے اور تم (بھاگ کر خدا کو) عاجز نہیں کرسکو گے",
        "اور اگر ہر ایک نافرمان شخص کے پاس روئے زمین کی تمام چیزیں ہوں تو (عذاب سے بچنے کے) بدلے میں (سب) دے ڈالے اور جب وہ عذاب کو دیکھیں گے تو (پچھتائیں گے اور) ندامت کو چھپائیں گے۔ اور ان میں انصاف کے ساتھ فیصلہ کر دیا جائے گا اور (کسی طرح کا) ان پر ظلم نہیں ہوگا",
        "سن رکھو جو کچھ آسمانوں اور زمینوں میں ہے سب خدا ہی کا ہے۔ اور یہ بھی سن رکھو کہ خدا کا وعدہ سچا ہے لیکن اکثر لوگ نہیں جانتے",
        "وہی جان بخشتا اور (وہی) موت دیتا ہے اور تم لوگ اسی کی طرف لوٹ کر جاؤ گے",
        "لوگو تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے نصیحت اور دلوں کی بیماریوں کی شفا۔ اور مومنوں کے لیے ہدایت اور رحمت آپہنچی ہے",
        "کہہ دو کہ (یہ کتاب) خدا کے فضل اور اس کی مہربانی سے (نازل ہوئی ہے) تو چاہیئے کہ لوگ اس سے خوش ہوں۔ یہ اس سے کہیں بہتر ہے جو وہ جمع کرتے ہیں",
        "کہو کہ بھلا دیکھو تو خدا نے تمھارے لئے جو رزق نازل فرمایا تو تم نے اس میں سے (بعض کو) حرام ٹھہرایا اور (بعض کو) حلال (ان سے) پوچھو کیا خدا نے تم کو اس کا حکم دیا ہے یا تم خدا پر افتراء کرتے ہو",
        "اور جو لوگ خدا پر افتراء کرتے ہیں وہ قیامت کے دن کی نسبت کیا خیال رکھتے ہیں؟ بےشک خدا لوگوں پر مہربان ہے لیکن اکثر لوگ شکر نہیں کرتے",
        "اور تم جس حال میں ہوتے ہو یا قرآن میں کچھ پڑھتے ہو یا تم لوگ کوئی (اور) کام کرتے ہو جب اس میں مصروف ہوتے ہو ہم تمہارے سامنے ہوتے ہیں اور تمہارے پروردگار سے ذرہ برابر بھی کوئی چیز پوشیدہ نہیں ہے نہ زمین میں نہ آسمان میں اور نہ کوئی چیز اس سے چھوٹی ہے یا بڑی مگر کتاب روشن میں (لکھی ہوئی) ہے",
        "سن رکھو کہ جو خدا کے دوست ہیں ان کو نہ کچھ خوف ہوگا اور نہ وہ غمناک ہوں گے",
        "(یعنی) جو لوگ ایمان لائے اور پرہیزگار رہے",
        "ان کے لیے دنیا کی زندگی میں بھی بشارت ہے اور آخرت میں بھی۔ خدا کی باتیں بدلتی نہیں۔ یہی تو بڑی کامیابی ہے",
        "اور (اے پیغمبر) ان لوگوں کی باتوں سے آزردہ نہ ہونا (کیونکہ) عزت سب خدا ہی کی ہے وہ (سب کچھ) سنتا (اور) جانتا ہے",
        "سن رکھو کہ جو مخلوق آسمانوں میں ہے اور جو زمین میں ہے سب خدا کے (بندے اور اس کے مملوک) ہیں۔ اور یہ جو خدا کے سوا (اپنے بنائے ہوئے) شریکوں کو پکارتے ہیں۔ وہ (کسی اور چیز کے) پیچھے نہیں چلتے۔ صرف ظن کے پیچھے چلتے ہیں اور محض اٹکلیں دوڑا رہے ہیں",
        "وہی تو ہے جس نے تمہارے لیے رات بنائی تاکہ اس میں آرام کرو اور روز روشن بنایا ( تاکہ اس میں کام کرو) جو لوگ (مادہٴ) سماعت رکھتے ہیں ان کے لیے ان میں نشانیاں ہیں",
        "(بعض لوگ) کہتے ہیں کہ خدا نے بیٹا بنا لیا ہے۔ اس کی ذات (اولاد سے) پاک ہے (اور) وہ بےنیاز ہے۔ جو کچھ آسمانوں میں ہے اور جو کچھ زمین میں ہے وہ سب اسی کا ہے (اے افتراء پردازو) تمہارے پاس اس (قول باطل) کی کوئی دلیل نہیں ہے۔ تم خدا کی نسبت ایسی بات کیوں کہتے ہو جو جانتے نہیں",
        "کہہ دو جو لوگ خدا پر جھوٹ بہتان باندھتے ہیں فلاح نہیں پائیں گے",
        "(ان کے لیے جو) فائدے ہیں دنیا میں (ہیں) پھر ان کو ہماری ہی طرف لوٹ کر آنا ہے۔ اس وقت ہم ان کو شدید عذاب (کے مزے) چکھائیں گے کیونکہ کفر (کی باتیں) کیا کرتے تھے",
        "اور ان کو نوح کا قصہ پڑھ کر سنادو۔ جب انہوں نے اپنی قوم سے کہا کہ اے قوم! اگر تم کو میرا تم میں رہنا اور خدا کی آیتوں سے نصیحت کرنا ناگوار ہو تو میں خدا پر بھروسہ رکھتا ہوں۔ تم اپنے شریکوں کے ساتھ مل کر ایک کام (جو میرے بارے میں کرنا چاہو) مقرر کرلو اور وہ تمہاری تمام جماعت (کو معلوم ہوجائے اور کسی) سے پوشیدہ نہ رہے اور پھر وہ کام میرے حق میں کر گزرو اور مجھے مہلت نہ دو",
        "اور اگر تم نے منہ پھیر لیا تو (تم جانتے ہو کہ) میں نے تم سے کچھ معاوضہ نہیں مانگا۔ میرا معاوضہ تو خدا کے ذمے ہے۔ اور مجھے حکم ہوا ہے کہ میں فرمانبرداروں میں رہوں",
        "لیکن ان لوگوں نے ان کی تکذیب کی تو ہم نے ان کو اور جو لوگ ان کے ساتھ کشتی میں سوار تھے سب کو (طوفان سے) بچا لیا اور انہیں (زمین میں) خلیفہ بنادیا اور جن لوگوں نے ہماری آیتوں کو جھٹلایا ان کو غرق کر دیا تو دیکھ لو کہ جو لوگ ڈرائے گئے تھے ان کا کیا انجام ہوا",
        "پھر نوح کے بعد ہم نے اور پیغمبر اپنی اپنی قوم کی طرف بھیجے۔ تو وہ ان کے پاس کھلی نشانیاں لے کر آئے۔ مگر وہ لوگ ایسے نہ تھے کہ جس چیز کی پہلے تکذیب کرچکے تھے اس پر ایمان لے آتے۔ اسی طرح ہم زیادتی کرنے والوں کے دلوں پر مہر لگا دیتے ہیں",
        "پھر ان کے بعد ہم نے موسیٰ اور ہارون کو اپنی نشانیاں دے کر فرعون اور اس کے سرداروں کے پاس بھیجا تو انہوں نے تکبر کیا اور وہ گنہگار لوگ تھے",
        "تو جب ان کے پاس ہمارے ہاں سے حق آیا تو کہنے لگے کہ یہ تو صریح جادو ہے",
        "موسیٰ نے کہا کیا تم حق کے بارے میں جب وہ تمہارے پاس آیا یہ کہتے ہو کہ یہ جادو ہے۔ حالانکہ جادوگر فلاح نہیں پانے کے",
        "وہ بولے کیا تم ہمارے پاس اس لئے آئے ہو کہ جس (راہ) پر ہم اپنے باپ دادا کو پاتے رہے ہیں اس سے ہم کو پھیردو۔ اور (اس) ملک میں تم دونوں کی ہی سرداری ہوجائے اور ہم تم پر ایمان لانے والے نہیں ہیں",
        "اور فرعون نے حکم دیا کہ سب کامل فن جادوگروں کو ہمارے پاس لے آؤ",
        "جب جادوگر آئے تو موسیٰ نے ان سے کہا تم کو جو ڈالنا ہے ڈالو",
        "جب انہوں نے (اپنی رسیوں اور لاٹھیوں کو) ڈالا تو موسیٰ نے کہا کہ جو چیزیں تم (بنا کر) لائے ہو جادو ہے خدا اس کو بھی نیست ونابود کردے گا۔ خدا شریروں کے کام سنوارا نہیں کرتا",
        "اور خدا اپنے حکم سے سچ کو سچ ہی کردے گا اگرچہ گنہگار برا ہی مانیں",
        "تو موسیٰ پر کوئی ایمان نہ لایا۔ مگر اس کی قوم میں سے چند لڑکے (اور وہ بھی) فرعون اور اس کے اہل دربار سے ڈرتے ڈرتے کہ کہیں وہ ان کو آفت میں نہ پھنسا دے۔ اور فرعون ملک میں متکبر ومتغلب اور (کبر وکفر) میں حد سے بڑھا ہوا تھا",
        "اور موسیٰ نے کہا کہ بھائیو! اگر تم خدا پر ایمان لائے ہو تو اگر (دل سے) فرمانبردار ہو تو اسی پر بھروسہ رکھو",
        "تو وہ بولے کہ ہم خدا ہی پر بھروسہ رکھتے ہیں۔ اے ہمارے پروردگار ہم کو ظالم لوگوں کے ہاتھ سے آزمائش میں نہ ڈال",
        "اور اپنی رحمت سے قوم کفار سے نجات بخش",
        "اور ہم نے موسیٰ اور اس کے بھائی کی طرف وحی بھیجی کہ اپنے لوگوں کے لیے مصر میں گھر بناؤ اور اپنے گھروں کو قبلہ (یعنی مسجدیں) ٹھہراؤ اور نماز پڑھو۔ اور مومنوں کو خوشخبری سنادو",
        "اور موسیٰ نے کہا اے ہمارے پروردگار تو نے فرعون اور اس کے سرداروں کو دنیا کی زندگی میں (بہت سا) سازو برگ اور مال وزر دے رکھا ہے۔ اے پروردگار ان کا مال یہ ہے کہ تیرے رستے سے گمراہ کردیں۔ اے پروردگار ان کے مال کو برباد کردے اور ان کے دلوں کو سخت کردے کہ ایمان نہ لائیں جب تک عذاب الیم نہ دیکھ لیں",
        "خدا نے فرمایا کہ تمہاری دعا قبول کرلی گئی تو تم ثابت قدم رہنا اور بےعقلوں کے رستے نہ چلنا",
        "اور ہم نے بنی اسرائیل کو دریا سے پار کردیا تو فرعون اور اس کے لشکر نے سرکشی اور تعدی سے ان کا تعاقب کیا۔ یہاں تک کہ جب اس کو غرق (کے عذاب) نے آپکڑا تو کہنے لگا کہ میں ایمان لایا کہ جس (خدا) پر بنی اسرائیل ایمان لائے ہیں اس کے سوا کوئی معبود نہیں اور میں فرمانبرداروں میں ہوں",
        "(جواب ملا کہ) اب (ایمان لاتا ہے) حالانکہ تو پہلے نافرمانی کرتا رہا اور مفسد بنا رہا",
        "تو آج ہم تیرے بدن کو (دریا سے) نکال لیں گے تاکہ تو پچھلوں کے لئے عبرت ہو۔ اور بہت سے لوگ ہماری نشانیوں سے بےخبر ہیں",
        "اور ہم نے بنی اسرائیل کو رہنے کو عمدہ جگہ دی اور کھانے کو پاکیزہ چیزیں عطا کیں لیکن وہ باوجود علم ہونے کے اختلاف کرتے رہے۔ بےشک جن باتوں میں وہ اختلاف کرتے رہے ہیں تمہارا پروردگار قیامت کے دن ان میں ان باتوں کا فیصلہ کردے گا",
        "اگر تم کو اس (کتاب کے) بارے میں جو ہم نے تم پر نازل کی ہے کچھ شک ہو تو جو لوگ تم سے پہلے کی (اُتری ہوئی) کتابیں پڑھتے ہیں ان سے پوچھ لو۔ تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے تمہارے پاس حق آچکا ہے تو تم ہرگز شک کرنے والوں میں نہ ہونا",
        "اور نہ ان لوگوں میں ہونا جو خدا کی آیتوں کی تکذیب کرتے ہیں نہیں تو نقصان اٹھاؤ گے",
        "جن لوگوں کے بارے میں خدا کا حکم (عذاب) قرار پاچکا ہے وہ ایمان نہیں لانے کے",
        "جب تک کہ عذاب الیم نہ دیکھ لیں خواہ ان کے پاس ہر (طرح کی) نشانی آجائے",
        "تو کوئی بستی ایسی کیوں نہ ہوئی کہ ایمان لاتی تو اس کا ایمان اسے نفع دیتا ہاں یونس کی قوم۔ جب ایمان لائی تو ہم نے دنیا کی زندگی میں ان سے ذلت کا عذاب دور کردیا اور ایک مدت تک (فوائد دنیاوی سے) ان کو بہرہ مند رکھا",
        "اور اگر تمہارا پروردگار چاہتا تو جتنے لوگ زمین پر ہیں سب کے سب ایمان لے آتے۔ تو کیا تم لوگوں پر زبردستی کرنا چاہتے ہو کہ وہ مومن ہوجائیں",
        "حالانکہ کسی شخص کو قدرت نہیں ہے کہ خدا کے حکم کے بغیر ایمان لائے۔ اور جو لوگ بےعقل ہیں ان پر وہ (کفر وذلت کی) نجاست ڈالتا ہے",
        "(ان کفار سے) کہو دیکھو تو زمین اور آسمانوں میں کیا کچھ ہے۔ مگر جو لوگ ایمان نہیں رکھتے ان کی نشانیاں اور ڈرواے کچھ کام نہیں آتے",
        "سو جیسے (برے) دن ان سے پہلے لوگوں پر گزر چکے ہیں اسی طرح کے (دنوں کے) یہ منتظر ہیں۔ کہہ دو کہ تم بھی انتظار کرو۔ میں بھی تمہارے ساتھ انتظار کرتا ہوں",
        "اور ہم اپنے پیغمبروں کو اور مومنوں کو نجات دیتے رہے ہیں۔ اسی طرح ہمارا ذمہ ہے کہ مسلمانوں کو نجات دیں",
        "(اے پیغمبر) کہہ دو کہ لوگو اگر تم کو میرے دین میں کسی طرح کا شک ہو تو (سن رکھو کہ) جن لوگوں کی تم خدا کے سوا عبادت کرتے ہو میں ان کی عبادت نہیں کرتا۔ بلکہ میں خدا کی عبادت کرتا ہوں جو تمھاری روحیں قبض کرلیتا ہے اور مجھ کو یہی حکم ہوا ہے کہ ایمان لانے والوں میں ہوں",
        "اور یہ کہ (اے محمد سب سے) یکسو ہو کر دین (اسلام) کی پیروی کئے جاؤ۔ اور مشرکوں میں ہرگز نہ ہونا",
        "اور خدا کو چھوڑ کر ایسی چیز کو نہ پکارنا جو نہ تمہارا کچھ بھلا کرسکے اور نہ کچھ بگاڑ سکے۔ اگر ایسا کرو گے تو ظالموں میں ہوجاؤ گے",
        "اور اگر خدا تم کو کوئی تکلیف پہنچائے تو اس کے سوا اس کا کوئی دور کرنے والا نہیں اور اگر تم سے بھلائی کرنی چاہے تو اس کے فضل کو کوئی روکنے والا نہیں۔ وہ اپنے بندوں میں سے جسے چاہتا ہے فائدہ پہنچاتا ہے اور وہ بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "کہہ دو کہ لوگو تمہارے پروردگار کے ہاں سے تمہارے پاس حق آچکا ہے تو جو کوئی ہدایت حاصل کرتا ہے تو ہدایت سے اپنے ہی حق میں بھلائی کرتا ہے۔ اور جو گمراہی اختیار کرتا ہے تو گمراہی سے اپنا ہی نقصان کرتا ہے۔ اور میں تمہارا وکیل نہیں ہوں",
        "اور (اے پیغمبر) تم کو جو حکم بھیجا جاتا ہے اس کی پیروی کئے جاؤ اور (تکلیفوں پر) صبر کرو یہاں تک کہ خدا فیصلہ کردے۔ اور وہ سب سے بہتر فیصلہ کرنے والا ہے"
