        "The revelation of this Book is from Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise.",
        "Indeed, We have sent down the Book to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth, so worship Allah ˹alone˺, being sincerely devoted to Him.",
        "Indeed, sincere devotion is due ˹only˺ to Allah. As for those who take other lords besides Him, ˹saying,˺ “We worship them only so they may bring us closer to Allah,” surely Allah will judge between all regarding what they differed about. Allah certainly does not guide whoever persists in lying and disbelief.",
        "Had it been Allah’s Will to have offspring, He could have chosen whatever He willed of His creation. Glory be to Him! He is Allah—the One, the Supreme.",
        "He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. He wraps the night around the day, and wraps the day around the night. And He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He is truly the Almighty, Most Forgiving.",
        "He created you ˹all˺ from a single soul, then from it He made its mate. And He produced for you four pairs of cattle. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers ˹in stages˺, one development after another, in three layers of darkness. That is Allah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be turned away?",
        "If you disbelieve, then ˹know that˺ Allah is truly not in need of you, nor does He approve of disbelief from His servants. But if you become grateful ˹through faith˺, He will appreciate that from you. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. He certainly knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.",
        "When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him ˹alone˺. But as soon as He showers them with blessings from Him, they ˹totally˺ forget the One they had cried to earlier, and set up equals to Allah to mislead ˹others˺ from His Way. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Enjoy your disbelief for a little while! You will certainly be one of the inmates of the Fire.”",
        "˹Are they better˺ or those who worship ˹their Lord˺ devoutly in the hours of the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of their Lord? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” None will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason.",
        "Say ˹O Prophet, that Allah says˺, “O My servants who believe! Be mindful of your Lord. Those who do good in this world will have a good reward. And Allah’s earth is spacious. Only those who endure patiently will be given their reward without limit.”",
        "Say, “I am commanded to worship Allah, being sincerely devoted to Him ˹alone˺.",
        "And I am commanded to be the first of those who submit ˹to His Will˺.”",
        "Say, “I truly fear—if I were to disobey my Lord—the torment of a tremendous Day.”",
        "Say, “It is ˹only˺ Allah that I worship, being sincere in my devotion to Him.",
        "Worship then whatever ˹gods˺ you want instead of Him.” Say, “The ˹true˺ losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on Judgment Day. That is indeed the clearest loss.”",
        "They will have layers of fire above and below them. That is what Allah warns His servants with. So fear Me, O  My servants!",
        "And those who shun the worship of false gods, turning to Allah ˹alone˺, will have good news. So give good news to My servants ˹O Prophet˺—",
        "those who listen to what is said and follow the best of it. These are the ones ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah, and these are ˹truly˺ the people of reason.",
        "What about those against whom the decree of torment has been justified? Is it you ˹O Prophet˺ who will then save those bound for the Fire?",
        "But those mindful of their Lord will have ˹elevated˺ mansions, built one above the other, under which rivers flow. ˹That is˺ the promise of Allah. ˹And˺ Allah never fails in ˹His˺ promise.",
        "Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky—channelling it through streams in the earth—then produces with it crops of various colours, then they dry up and you see them wither, and then He reduces them to chaff? Surely in this is a reminder for people of reason.",
        "Can ˹the misguided be like˺ those whose hearts Allah has opened to Islam, so they are enlightened by their Lord? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened at the remembrance of Allah! It is they who are clearly astray.",
        "˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ has sent down the best message—a Book of perfect consistency and repeated lessons—which causes the skin ˹and hearts˺ of those who fear their Lord to tremble, then their skin and hearts soften at the mention of ˹the mercy of˺ Allah. That is the guidance of Allah, through which He guides whoever He wills. But whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide.",
        "Are those who will only have their ˹bare˺ faces to shield themselves from the awful torment on Judgment Day ˹better than those in Paradise˺? It will ˹then˺ be said to the wrongdoers: “Reap what you sowed!”",
        "Those before them ˹also˺ rejected ˹the truth˺, then the torment came upon them from where they least expected.",
        "So Allah made them taste humiliation in this worldly life, but far worse is the punishment of the Hereafter, if only they knew.",
        "We have certainly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people in this Quran, so perhaps they will be mindful.",
        "˹It is˺ a Quran ˹revealed˺ in Arabic without any crookedness, so perhaps they will be conscious ˹of Allah˺.",
        "Allah sets forth the parable of a slave owned by several quarrelsome masters, and a slave owned by only one master. Are they equal in condition? Praise be to Allah! In fact, most of them do not know.",
        "You ˹O Prophet˺ will certainly die, and they will die too.",
        "Then on the Day of Judgment you will ˹all settle your˺ dispute before your Lord.",
        "Who then does more wrong than those who lie about Allah and reject the truth after it has reached them? Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the disbelievers?",
        "And the one who has brought the truth and those who embrace it—it is they who are the righteous.",
        "They will have whatever they desire with their Lord. That is the reward of the good-doers.",
        "As such, Allah will absolve them of ˹even˺ the worst of what they did and reward them according to the best of what they used to do.",
        "Is Allah not sufficient for His servant? Yet they threaten you with other ˹powerless˺ gods besides Him! Whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide.",
        "And whoever Allah guides, none can lead astray. Is Allah not Almighty, capable of punishment?",
        "If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say, “Allah!” Ask ˹them˺, “Consider then whatever ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah: if it was Allah’s Will to harm me, could they undo that harm? Or if He willed ˹some˺ mercy for me, could they withhold His mercy?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me. In Him ˹alone˺ the faithful put their trust.”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O my people! Persist in your ways, for I ˹too˺ will persist in mine. You will soon come to know",
        "who will be visited by a humiliating torment ˹in this life˺ and overwhelmed by an everlasting punishment ˹in the next˺.”",
        "Surely We have revealed to you the Book ˹O Prophet˺ with the truth for humanity. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. You are not a keeper over them.",
        "˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ calls back the souls ˹of people˺ upon their death as well as ˹the souls˺ of the living during their sleep. Then He keeps those for whom He has ordained death, and releases the others until ˹their˺ appointed time. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.",
        "Or have they taken others besides Allah as intercessors? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Would they do so,˺ even though those ˹idols˺ have neither authority nor intelligence?”",
        "Say, “All intercession belongs to Allah ˹alone˺. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.”",
        "Yet when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter are filled with disgust. But as soon as those ˹gods˺ other than Him are mentioned, they are filled with joy.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O Allah—Originator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the seen and unseen! You will judge between Your servants regarding their differences.”",
        "Even if the wrongdoers were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves from the horrible punishment on Judgment Day, for they will see from Allah what they had never expected.",
        "And the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds will unfold before them, and they will be overwhelmed by what they used to ridicule.",
        "When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to Us ˹alone˺. Then when We shower Our blessings upon them, they say, “I have been granted all this only because of ˹my˺ knowledge.” Not at all! It is ˹no more than˺ a test. But most of them do not know.",
        "The same had already been said by those ˹destroyed˺ before them, but their ˹worldly˺ gains were of no benefit to them.",
        "So the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds overtook them. And the wrongdoers among these ˹pagans˺ will be overtaken by the evil ˹consequences˺ of their deeds. And they will have no escape.",
        "Do they not know that Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills? Surely in this are signs for people who believe.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet, that Allah says,˺ “O My servants who have exceeded the limits against their souls! Do not lose hope in Allah’s mercy, for Allah certainly forgives all sins. He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "Turn to your Lord ˹in repentance˺, and ˹fully˺ submit to Him before the punishment reaches you, ˹for˺ then you will not be helped.",
        "Follow ˹the Quran,˺ the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord, before the punishment takes you by surprise while you are unaware",
        "so that no ˹sinful˺ soul will say ˹on Judgment Day˺, ‘Woe to me for neglecting ˹my duties towards˺ Allah, while ridiculing ˹the truth˺.’",
        "Or ˹a soul will˺ say, ‘If only Allah had guided me, I would have certainly been one of the righteous.’",
        "Or say, upon seeing the torment, ‘If only I had a second chance, I would have been one of the good-doers.’",
        "Not at all! My revelations had already come to you, but you rejected them, acted arrogantly, and were one of the disbelievers.”",
        "On the Day of Judgment you will see those who lied about Allah with their faces gloomy. Is Hell not a ˹fitting˺ home for the arrogant?",
        "And Allah will deliver those who were mindful ˹of Him˺ to their place of ˹ultimate˺ triumph. No evil will touch them, nor will they grieve.",
        "Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Maintainer of everything.",
        "To Him belong the keys ˹of the treasuries˺ of the heavens and the earth. As for those who rejected the signs of Allah, it is they who will be the ˹true˺ losers.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Are you urging me to worship ˹anyone˺ other than Allah, O  ignorant ones?”",
        "It has already been revealed to you—and to those ˹prophets˺ before you—that if you associate others ˹with Allah˺, your deeds will certainly be void and you will truly be one of the losers.",
        "Rather, worship Allah ˹alone˺ and be one of the grateful.",
        "They have not shown Allah His proper reverence—when on the Day of Judgment the ˹whole˺ earth will be in His Grip, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺!",
        "The Trumpet will be blown and all those in the heavens and all those on the earth will fall dead, except those Allah wills ˹to spare˺. Then it will be blown again and they will rise up at once, looking on ˹in anticipation˺.",
        "The earth will shine with the light of its Lord, the record ˹of deeds˺ will be laid ˹open˺, the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward—and judgment will be passed on all with fairness. None will be wronged.",
        "Every soul will be paid in full for its deeds, for Allah knows best what they have done.",
        "Those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in ˹successive˺ groups. When they arrive there, its gates will be opened and its keepers will ask them: “Did messengers not come to you from among yourselves, reciting to you the revelations of your Lord and warning you of the coming of this Day of yours?” The disbelievers will cry, “Yes ˹indeed˺! But the decree of torment has come to pass against the disbelievers.”",
        "It will be said to them, “Enter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever.” What an evil home for the arrogant!",
        "And those who were mindful of their Lord will be led to Paradise in ˹successive˺ groups. When they arrive at its ˹already˺ open gates, its keepers will say, “Peace be upon you! You have done well, so come in, to stay forever.”",
        "The righteous will say, “Praise be to Allah Who has fulfilled His promise to us, and made us inherit the ˹everlasting˺ land to settle in Paradise wherever we please.” How excellent is the reward of those who work ˹righteousness˺!",
        "You will see the angels all around the Throne, glorifying the praises of their Lord, for judgment will have been passed on all with fairness. And it will be said, “Praise be to Allah—Lord of all worlds!”"

        "অবশ্যই তাদের পূর্ববর্তীরা এটা বলেছিল। কিন্তু তারা যা অর্জন করেছে তা তাদের কোন কাজে আসেনি।",
        "সুতরাং তাদের কৃতকর্মের মন্দ ফল তাদের উপর আপতিত হয়েছিল। এদের মধ্যেও যারা যুলম করে তাদের উপরেও তাদের অর্জনের সব মন্দফল শীঘ্রই আপতিত হবে। আর তারা অক্ষম করতে পারবে না।",
        "তারা কি জানে না, আল্লাহ যার জন্য ইচ্ছা করেন রিয্ক প্রশস্ত করে দেন আর সঙ্কুচিত করে দেন? নিশ্চয় এতে মুমিন সম্প্রদায়ের জন্য নিদর্শনাবলী রয়েছে।",

        "আর তারা আল্লাহকে যথাযোগ্য মর্যাদা দেয়নি। অথচ কিয়ামতের দিন গোটা পৃথিবীই থাকবে তাঁর মুষ্টিতে এবং আকাশসমূহ তাঁর ডান হাতে ভাঁজ করা থাকবে। তিনি পবিত্র, তারা যাদেরকে শরীক করে তিনি তাদের ঊর্ধ্বে।",
        "আর শিঙ্গায় ফুঁক দেয়া হবে। ফলে আল্লাহ যাদেরকে ইচ্ছা করেন তারা ছাড়া আসমানসমূহে যারা আছে এবং পৃথিবীতে যারা আছে সকলেই বেহুঁশ হয়ে পড়বে। তারপর আবার শিঙ্গায় ফুঁক দেয়া হবে, তখন তারা দাঁড়িয়ে তাকাতে থাকবে।",
        "আর যমীন তার রবের নূরে আলোকিত হবে, আমলনামা উপস্থিত করা হবে এবং নবী ও সাক্ষীগণকে আনা হবে, তাদের মধ্যে ন্যায়বিচার করা হবে। এমতাবস্থায় যে, তাদের প্রতি যুলম করা হবে না।",

        "اسی نے آسمانوں اور زمین کو تدبیر کے ساتھ پیدا کیا ہے۔ (اور) وہی رات کو دن پر لپیٹتا ہے اور دن کو رات پر لپیٹتا ہے اور اسی نے سورج اور چاند کو بس میں کر رکھا ہے۔ سب ایک وقت مقرر تک چلتے رہیں گے۔ دیکھو وہی غالب (اور) بخشنے والا ہے",
        "اسی نے تم کو ایک شخص سے پیدا کیا پھر اس سے اس کا جوڑا بنایا اور اسی نے تمہارے لئے چار پایوں میں سے آٹھ جوڑے بنائے۔ وہی تم کو تمہاری ماؤں کے پیٹ میں (پہلے) ایک طرح پھر دوسری طرح تین اندھیروں میں بناتا ہے۔ یہی خدا تمہارا پروردگار ہے اسی کی بادشاہی ہے۔ اس کے سوا کوئی معبود نہیں پھر تم کہاں پھرے جاتے ہو؟",
        "اگر ناشکری کرو گے تو خدا تم سے بےپروا ہے۔ اور وہ اپنے بندوں کے لئے ناشکری پسند نہیں کرتا اور اگر شکر کرو گے تو وہ اس کو تمہارے لئے پسند کرے گا۔ اور کوئی اٹھانے والا دوسرے کا بوجھ نہیں اٹھائے گا۔ پھر تم اپنے پروردگار کی طرف لوٹنا ہے۔ پھر جو کچھ تم کرتے رہے وہ تم کو بتائے گا۔ وہ تو دلوں کی پوشیدہ باتوں تک سے آگاہ ہے",
        "اور جب انسان کو تکلیف پہنچتی ہے تو اپنے پروردگار کو پکارتا (اور) اس کی طرف دل سے رجوع کرتا ہے۔ پھر جب وہ اس کو اپنی طرف سے کوئی نعمت دیتا ہے تو جس کام کے لئے پہلے اس کو پکارتا ہے اسے بھول جاتا ہے اور خدا کا شریک بنانے لگتا ہے تاکہ (لوگوں کو) اس کے رستے سے گمراہ کرے۔ کہہ دو کہ (اے کافر نعمت) اپنی ناشکری سے تھوڑا سا فائدہ اٹھالے۔ پھر تُو تو دوزخیوں میں ہوگا",
        "(بھلا مشرک اچھا ہے) یا وہ جو رات کے وقتوں میں زمین پر پیشانی رکھ کر اور کھڑے ہو کر عبادت کرتا اور آخرت سے ڈرتا اور اپنے پروردگار کی رحمت کی امید رکھتا ہے۔ کہو بھلا جو لوگ علم رکھتے ہیں اور جو نہیں رکھتے دونوں برابر ہوسکتے ہیں؟ (اور) نصیحت تو وہی پکڑتے ہیں جو عقلمند ہیں",
        "کہہ دو کہ اے میرے بندو جو ایمان لائے ہو اپنے پروردگار سے ڈرو۔ جنہوں نے اس دنیا میں نیکی کی ان کے لئے بھلائی ہے۔ اور خدا کی زمین کشادہ ہے۔ جو صبر کرنے والے ہیں ان کو بےشمار ثواب ملے گا",
        "کہہ دو کہ مجھ سے ارشاد ہوا ہے کہ خدا کی عبادت کو خالص کرکے اس کی بندگی کروں",
        "اور یہ بھی ارشاد ہوا ہے کہ میں سب سے اول مسلمان بنوں",
        "کہہ دو کہ اگر میں اپنے پروردگار کا حکم نہ مانوں تو مجھے بڑے دن کے عذاب سے ڈر لگتا ہے",
        "کہہ دو کہ میں اپنے دین کو (شرک سے) خالص کرکے اس کی عبادت کرتا ہوں",
        "تو تم اس کے سوا جس کی چاہو پرستش کرو۔ کہہ دو کہ نقصان اٹھانے والے وہی لوگ ہیں جنہوں نے قیامت کے دن اپنے آپ کو اور اپنے گھر والوں کو نقصان میں ڈالا۔ دیکھو یہی صریح نقصان ہے",
        "ان کے اوپر تو آگ کے سائبان ہوں گے اور نیچے (اس کے) فرش ہوں گے۔ یہ وہ (عذاب) ہے جس سے خدا اپنے بندوں کو ڈراتا ہے۔ تو اے میرے بندو مجھ سے ڈرتے رہو",
        "اور جنہوں نے اس سے اجتناب کیا کہ بتوں کو پوجیں اور خدا کی طرف رجوع کیا ان کے لئے بشارت ہے۔ تو میرے بندوں کو بشارت سنا دو",
        "جو بات کو سنتے اور اچھی باتوں کی پیروی کرتے ہیں۔ یہی وہ لوگ ہیں جن کو خدا نے ہدایت دی اور یہی عقل والے ہیں",
        "بھلا جس شخص پر عذاب کا حکم صادر ہوچکا۔ تو کیا تم (ایسے) دوزخی کو مخلصی دے سکو گے؟",
        "لیکن جو لوگ اپنے پروردگار سے ڈرتے ہیں ان کے لئے اونچے اونچے محل ہیں جن کے اوپر بالا خانے بنے ہوئے ہیں۔ (اور) ان کے نیچے نہریں بہہ رہی ہیں۔ (یہ) خدا کا وعدہ ہے۔ خدا وعدے کے خلاف نہیں کرتا",
        "کیا تم نے نہیں دیکھا کہ خدا آسمان سے پانی نازل کرتا پھر اس کو زمین میں چشمے بنا کر جاری کرتا پھر اس سے کھیتی اُگاتا ہے جس کے طرح طرح کے رنگ ہوتے ہیں۔ پھر وہ خشک ہوجاتی ہے تو تم اس کو دیکھتے ہو (کہ) زرد (ہوگئی ہے) پھر اسے چورا چورا کر دیتا ہے۔ بےشک اس میں عقل والوں کے لئے نصیحت ہے",
        "بھلا جس شخص کا سینہ خدا نے اسلام کے لئے کھول دیا ہو اور وہ اپنے پروردگار کی طرف سے روشنی پر ہو (تو کیا وہ سخت دل کافر کی طرح ہوسکتا ہے) پس ان پر افسوس ہے جن کے دل خدا کی یاد سے سخت ہو رہے ہیں۔ اور یہی لوگ صریح گمراہی میں ہیں",
        "خدا نے نہایت اچھی باتیں نازل فرمائی ہیں (یعنی) کتاب (جس کی آیتیں باہم) ملتی جلتی (ہیں) اور دہرائی جاتی (ہیں) جو لوگ اپنے پروردگار سے ڈرتے ہیں ان کے بدن کے (اس سے) رونگٹے کھڑے ہوجاتے ہیں۔ پھر ان کے بدن اور دل نرم (ہو کر) خدا کی یاد کی طرف (متوجہ) ہوجاتے ہیں۔ یہی خدا کی ہدایت ہے وہ اس سے جس کو چاہتا ہے ہدایت دیتا ہے۔ اور جس کو خدا گمراہ کرے اس کو کوئی ہدایت دینے والا نہیں",
        "بھلا جو شخص قیامت کے دن اپنے منہ سے برے عذاب کو روکتا ہو (کیا وہ ویسا ہوسکتا ہے جو چین میں ہو) اور ظالموں سے کہا جائے گا کہ جو کچھ تم کرتے رہے تھے اس کے مزے چکھو",
        "جو لوگ ان سے پہلے تھے انہوں نے بھی تکذیب کی تھی تو ان پر عذاب ایسی جگہ سے آگیا کہ ان کو خبر ہی نہ تھی",
        "پھر ان کو خدا نے دنیا کی زندگی میں رسوائی کا مزہ چکھا دیا۔ اور آخرت کا عذاب تو بہت بڑا ہے۔ کاش یہ سمجھ رکھتے",
        "اور ہم نے لوگوں کے (سمجھانے کے) لئے اس قرآن میں ہر طرح کی مثالیں بیان کی ہیں تاکہ وہ نصیحت پکڑیں",
        "یہ) قرآن عربی (ہے) جس میں کوئی عیب (اور اختلاف) نہیں تاکہ وہ ڈر مانیں",
        "خدا ایک مثال بیان کرتا ہے کہ ایک شخص ہے جس میں کئی (آدمی) شریک ہیں۔ (مختلف المزاج اور) بدخو اور ایک آدمی خاص ایک شخص کا (غلام) ہے۔ بھلا دونوں کی حالت برابر ہے۔ (نہیں) الحمدلله بلکہ یہ اکثر لوگ نہیں جانتے",
        "(اے پیغمبر) تم بھی مر جاؤ گے اور یہ بھی مر جائیں گے",
        "پھر تم سب قیامت کے دن اپنے پروردگار کے سامنے جھگڑو گے (اور جھگڑا فیصل کردیا جائے گا)",
        "تو اس سے بڑھ کر ظالم کون جو خدا پر جھوٹ بولے اور سچی بات جب اس کے پاس پہنچ جائے تو اسے جھٹلائے۔ کیا جہنم میں کافروں کا ٹھکانا نہیں ہے؟",
        "اور جو شخص سچی بات لے کر آیا اور جس نے اس کی تصدیق کی وہی لوگ متقی ہیں",
        "وہ جو چاہیں گے ان کے لئے ان کے پروردگار کے پاس (موجود) ہے۔ نیکوکاروں کا یہی بدلہ ہے",
        "تاکہ خدا ان سے برائیوں کو جو انہوں نے کیں دور کردے اور نیک کاموں کا جو وہ کرتے رہے ان کو بدلہ دے",
        "کیا خدا اپنے بندوں کو کافی نہیں۔ اور یہ تم کو ان لوگوں سے جو اس کے سوا ہیں (یعنی غیر خدا سے) ڈراتے ہیں۔ اور جس کو خدا گمراہ کرے اسے کوئی ہدایت دینے والا نہیں",
        "اور جس کو خدا ہدایت دے اس کو کوئی گمراہ کرنے والا نہیں۔ کیا خدا غالب (اور) بدلہ لینے والا نہیں ہے؟",
        "اور اگر تم ان سے پوچھو کہ آسمانوں اور زمین کو کس نے پیدا کیا تو کہہ دیں کہ خدا نے۔ کہو کہ بھلا دیکھو تو جن کو تم خدا کے سوا پکارتے ہو۔ اگر خدا مجھ کو کوئی تکلیف پہنچانی چاہے تو کیا وہ اس تکلیف کو دور کرسکتے ہیں یا اگر مجھ پر مہربانی کرنا چاہے تو وہ اس کی مہربانی کو روک سکتے ہیں؟ کہہ دو کہ مجھے خدا ہی کافی ہے۔ بھروسہ رکھنے والے اسی پر بھروسہ رکھتے ہیں",
        "کہہ دو کہ اے قوم تم اپنی جگہ عمل کئے جاؤ میں (اپنی جگہ) عمل کئے جاتا ہوں۔ عنقریب تم کو معلوم ہوجائے گا",
        "کہ کس پر عذاب آتا ہے جو اسے رسوا کرے گا۔ اور کس پر ہمیشہ کا عذاب نازل ہوتا ہے",
        "ہم نے تم پر کتاب لوگوں (کی ہدایت) کے لئے سچائی کے ساتھ نازل کی ہے۔ تو جو شخص ہدایت پاتا ہے تو اپنے (بھلے کے) لئے اور جو گمراہ ہوتا ہے گمراہی سے تو اپنا ہی نقصان کرتا ہے۔ اور (اے پیغمبر) تم ان کے ذمہ دار نہیں ہو",
        "خدا لوگوں کے مرنے کے وقت ان کی روحیں قبض کرلیتا ہے اور جو مرے نہیں (ان کی روحیں) سوتے میں (قبض کرلیتا ہے) پھر جن پر موت کا حکم کرچکتا ہے ان کو روک رکھتا ہے اور باقی روحوں کو ایک وقت مقرر تک کے لئے چھوڑ دیتا ہے۔ جو لوگ فکر کرتے ہیں ان کے لئے اس میں نشانیاں ہیں",
        "کیا انہوں نے خدا کے سوا اور سفارشی بنالئے ہیں۔ کہو کہ خواہ وہ کسی چیز کا بھی اختیار نہ رکھتے ہوں اور نہ (کچھ) سمجھتے ہی ہوں",
        "کہہ دو کہ سفارش تو سب خدا ہی کے اختیار میں ہے۔ اسی کے لئے آسمانوں اور زمین کی بادشاہت ہے۔ پھر تم اسی کی طرف لوٹ کر جاؤ گے",
        "اور جب تنہا خدا کا ذکر کیا جاتا ہے تو جو لوگ آخرت پر ایمان نہیں رکھتے ان کے دل منقبض ہوجاتے ہیں۔ اور جب اس کے سوا اوروں کا ذکر کیا جاتا ہے تو خوش ہوجاتے ہیں",
        "کہو کہ اے خدا (اے) آسمانوں اور زمین کے پیدا کرنے والے (اور) پوشیدہ اور ظاہر کے جاننے والے تو ہی اپنے بندوں میں ان باتوں کا جن میں وہ اختلاف کرتے رہے ہیں فیصلہ کرے گا",
        "اور اگر ظالموں کے پاس وہ سب (مال ومتاع) ہو جو زمین میں ہے اور اس کے ساتھ اسی قدر اور ہو تو قیامت کے روز برے عذاب (سے مخلصی پانے) کے بدلے میں دے دیں۔ اور ان پر خدا کی طرف سے وہ امر ظاہر ہوجائے گا جس کا ان کو خیال بھی نہ تھا",
        "اور ان کے اعمال کی برائیاں ان پر ظاہر ہوجائیں گی اور جس (عذاب) کی وہ ہنسی اُڑاتے تھے وہ ان کو آگھیرے گا",
        "جب انسان کو تکلیف پہنچتی ہے تو ہمیں پکارنے لگتا ہے۔ پھر جب ہم اس کو اپنی طرف سے نعمت بخشتے ہیں تو کہتا ہے کہ یہ تو مجھے (میرے) علم (ودانش) کے سبب ملی ہے۔ (نہیں) بلکہ وہ آزمائش ہے مگر ان میں سے اکثر نہیں جانتے",
        "جو لوگ ان سے پہلے تھے وہ بھی یہی کہا کرتے تھے تو جو کچھ وہ کیا کرتے تھے ان کے کچھ بھی کام نہ آیا",
        "ان پر ان کے اعمال کے وبال پڑ گئے۔ اور جو لوگ ان میں سے ظلم کرتے رہے ہیں ان پر ان کے عملوں کے وبال عنقریب پڑیں گے۔ اور وہ (خدا کو) عاجز نہیں کرسکتے",
        "کیا ان کو معلوم نہیں کہ خدا ہی جس کے لئے چاہتا ہے رزق کو فراخ کردیتا ہے اور (جس کے لئے چاہتا ہے) تنگ کر دیتا ہے۔ جو لوگ ایمان لاتے ہیں ان کے لئے اس میں (بہت سی) نشانیاں ہیں",
        "(اے پیغمبر میری طرف سے لوگوں کو) کہہ دو کہ اے میرے بندو جنہوں نے اپنی جانوں پر زیادتی کی ہے خدا کی رحمت سے ناامید نہ ہونا۔ خدا تو سب گناہوں کو بخش دیتا ہے۔ (اور) وہ تو بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "اور اس سے پہلے کہ تم پر عذاب آ واقع ہو، اپنے پروردگار کی طرف رجوع کرو اور اس کے فرمانبردار ہوجاؤ پھر تم کو مدد نہیں ملے گی",
        "اور اس سے پہلے کہ تم پر ناگہاں عذاب آجائے اور تم کو خبر بھی نہ ہو اس نہایت اچھی (کتاب) کی جو تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے تم پر نازل ہوئی ہے پیروی کرو",
        "کہ (مبادا اس وقت) کوئی متنفس کہنے لگے کہ (ہائے ہائے) اس تقصیر پر افسوس ہے جو میں نے خدا کے حق میں کی اور میں تو ہنسی ہی کرتا رہا",
        "یا یہ کہنے لگے کہ اگر خدا مجھ کو ہدایت دیتا تو میں بھی پرہیزگاروں میں ہوتا",
        "یا جب عذاب دیکھ لے تو کہنے لگے کہ اگر مجھے پھر ایک دفعہ دنیا میں جانا ہو تو میں نیکوکاروں میں ہو جاؤں",
        "(خدا فرمائے گا) کیوں نہیں میری آیتیں تیرے پاس پہنچ گئی ہیں مگر تو نے ان کو جھٹلایا اور شیخی میں آگیا اور تو کافر بن گیا",
        "اور جن لوگوں نے خدا پر جھوٹ بولا تم قیامت کے دن دیکھو گے کہ ان کے منہ کالے ہو رہے ہوں گے۔ کیا غرور کرنے والوں کو ٹھکانا دوزخ میں نہیں ہے",
        "اور جو پرہیزگار ہیں ان کی (سعادت اور) کامیابی کے سبب خدا ان کو نجات دے گا نہ تو ان کو کوئی سختی پہنچے گی اور نہ غمناک ہوں گے",
        "خدا ہی ہر چیز کا پیدا کرنے والا ہے۔ اور وہی ہر چیز کا نگراں ہے",
        "اسی کے پاس آسمانوں اور زمین کی کنجیاں ہیں۔ اور جنہوں نے خدا کی آیتوں سے کفر کیا وہی نقصان اُٹھانے والے ہیں",
        "کہہ دو کہ اے نادانو! تم مجھ سے یہ کہتے ہو کہ میں غیر خدا کی پرستش کرنے لگوں",
        "اور (اے محمدﷺ) تمہاری طرف اور ان (پیغمبروں) کی طرف جو تم سے پہلے ہوچکے ہیں یہی وحی بھیجی گئی ہے۔ کہ اگر تم نے شرک کیا تو تمہارے عمل برباد ہوجائیں گے اور تم زیاں کاروں میں ہوجاؤ گے",
        "بلکہ خدا ہی کی عبادت کرو اور شکرگزاروں میں ہو",
        "اور انہوں نے خدا کی قدر شناسی جیسی کرنی چاہیئے تھی نہیں کی۔ اور قیامت کے دن تمام زمین اس کی مٹھی میں ہوگی اور آسمان اس کے داہنے ہاتھ میں لپٹے ہوں گے۔ (اور) وہ ان لوگوں کے شرک سے پاک اور عالی شان ہے",
        "اور جب صور پھونکا جائے گا تو جو لوگ آسمان میں ہیں اور جو زمین میں ہیں سب بےہوش ہو کر گر پڑیں گے مگر وہ جس کو خدا چاہے۔ پھر دوسری دفعہ پھونکا جائے گا تو فوراً سب کھڑے ہو کر دیکھنے لگیں گے",
        "اور زمین اپنے پروردگار کے نور سے جگمگا اُٹھے گی اور (اعمال کی) کتاب (کھول کر) رکھ دی جائے گی اور پیغمبر اور (اور) گواہ حاضر کئے جائیں گے اور ان میں انصاف کے ساتھ فیصلہ کیا جائے گا اور بےانصافی نہیں کی جائے گی",
        "اور جس شخص نے جو عمل کیا ہوگا اس کو اس کا پورا پورا بدلہ مل جائے گا اور جو کچھ یہ کرتے ہیں اس کو سب کی خبر ہے",
        "اور کافروں کو گروہ گروہ بنا کر جہنم کی طرف لے جائیں گے۔ یہاں تک کہ جب وہ اس کے پاس پہنچ جائیں گے تو اس کے دروازے کھول دیئے جائیں گے تو اس کے داروغہ ان سے کہیں گے کہ کیا تمہارے پاس تم ہی میں سے پیغمبر نہیں آئے تھے جو تم کو تمہارے پروردگار کی آیتیں پڑھ پڑھ کر سناتے اور اس دن کے پیش آنے سے ڈراتے تھے کہیں گے کیوں نہیں لیکن کافروں کے حق میں عذاب کا حکم متحقق ہوچکا تھا",
        "کہا جائے گا کہ دوزخ کے دروازوں میں داخل ہوجاؤ ہمیشہ اس میں رہو گے۔ تکبر کرنے والوں کا برا ٹھکانا ہے",
        "اور جو لوگ اپنے پروردگار سے ڈرتے ہیں ان کو گروہ گروہ بنا کر بہشت کی طرف لے جائیں گے یہاں تک کہ جب اس کے پاس پہنچ جائیں گے اور اس کے دروازے کھول دیئے جائیں گے تو اس کے داروغہ ان سے کہیں کہ تم پر سلام تم بہت اچھے رہے۔ اب اس میں ہمیشہ کے لئے داخل ہوجاؤ",
        "وہ کہیں گے کہ خدا کا شکر ہے جس نے اپنے وعدہ کو ہم سے سچا کردیا اور ہم کو اس زمین کا وارث بنا دیا ہم بہشت میں جس مکان میں چاہیں رہیں تو (اچھے) عمل کرنے والوں کا بدلہ بھی کیسا خوب ہے",
        "تم فرشتوں کو دیکھو گے کہ عرش کے گرد گھیرا باندھے ہوئے ہیں (اور) اپنے پروردگار کی تعریف کے ساتھ تسبیح کر رہے ہیں۔ اور ان میں انصاف کے ساتھ فیصلہ کیا جائے گا اور کہا جائے گا کہ ہر طرح کی تعریف خدا ہی کو سزاوار ہے جو سارے جہان کا مالک ہے"
