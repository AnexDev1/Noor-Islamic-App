        "Alif-Lãm-Mĩm-Ṣãd.",
        "˹This is˺ a Book sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺—do not let anxiety into your heart regarding it—so with it you may warn ˹the disbelievers˺, and as a reminder to the believers.",
        "Follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord, and do not take others as guardians besides Him. How seldom are you mindful!",
        "˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed! Our torment took them by surprise ˹while sleeping˺ at night or midday.",
        "Their only cry—when overwhelmed by Our torment—was, “We have indeed been wrongdoers.”",
        "We will surely question those who received messengers and We will question the messengers ˹themselves˺.",
        "Then We will give them a full account with sure knowledge—for We were never absent.",
        "The weighing on that Day will be just. As for those whose scale will be heavy ˹with good deeds˺, ˹only˺ they will be successful.",
        "But those whose scale is light, they have doomed themselves for wrongfully denying Our signs.",
        "We have indeed established you on earth and provided you with a means of livelihood. ˹Yet˺ you seldom give any thanks.",
        "Surely We created you, then shaped you, then said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who refused to prostrate with the others.",
        "Allah asked, “What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?” He replied, “I am better than he is: You created me from fire and him from clay.”",
        "Allah said, “Then get down from Paradise! It is not for you to be arrogant here. So get out! You are truly one of the disgraced.”",
        "He appealed, “Then delay my end until the Day of their resurrection.”",
        "Allah said, “You are delayed ˹until the appointed Day˺.”",
        "He said, “For leaving me to stray I will lie in ambush for them on Your Straight Path.",
        "I will approach them from their front, their back, their right, their left, and then You will find most of them ungrateful.”",
        "Allah said, “Get out of Paradise! You are disgraced and rejected! I will certainly fill up Hell with you and your followers all together.”",
        "˹Allah said,˺ “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat from wherever you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be wrongdoers.”",
        "Then Satan tempted them in order to expose what was hidden of their nakedness. He said, “Your Lord has forbidden this tree to you only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals.”",
        "And he swore to them, “I am truly your sincere advisor.”",
        "So he brought about their fall through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise. Then their Lord called out to them, “Did I not forbid you from that tree and ˹did I not˺ tell you that Satan is your sworn enemy?”",
        "They replied, “Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will certainly be losers.”",
        "Allah said, “Descend as enemies to each other. You will find in the earth a residence and provision for your appointed stay.”",
        "He added, “There you will live, there you will die, and from there you will be resurrected.”",
        "O children of Adam! We have provided for you clothing to cover your nakedness and as an adornment. However, the best clothing is righteousness. This is one of Allah’s bounties, so perhaps you will be mindful.",
        "O children of Adam! Do not let Satan deceive you as he tempted your parents out of Paradise and caused their cover to be removed in order to expose their nakedness. Surely he and his soldiers watch you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils allies of those who disbelieve.",
        "Whenever they commit a shameful deed, they say, “We found our forefathers doing it and Allah has commanded us to do it.” Say, “No! Allah never commands what is shameful. How can you attribute to Allah what you do not know?”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord has commanded uprightness and dedication ˹to Him alone˺ in worship, calling upon Him with sincere devotion. Just as He first brought you into being, you will be brought to life again.”",
        "He has guided some, while others are destined to stray. They have taken devils as their masters instead of Allah—thinking they are ˹rightly˺ guided.",
        "O Children of Adam! Dress properly whenever you are at worship. Eat and drink, but do not waste. Surely He does not like the wasteful.",
        "Ask, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has forbidden the adornments and lawful provisions Allah has brought forth for His servants?” Say, “They are for the enjoyment of the believers in this worldly life, but they will be exclusively theirs on the Day of Judgment. This is how We make Our revelations clear for people of knowledge.”",
        "Say, “My Lord has only forbidden open and secret indecencies, sinfulness, unjust aggression, associating ˹others˺ with Allah ˹in worship˺—a practice He has never authorized—and attributing to Allah what you do not know.”",
        "For each community there is an appointed term. When their time arrives, they can neither delay it for a moment, nor could they advance it.",
        "O children of Adam! When messengers from among yourselves come to you reciting My revelations—whoever shuns evil and mends their ways, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
        "But those who receive Our revelations with denial and arrogance will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.",
        "Who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against Allah or deny His revelations? They will receive what is destined for them, until Our messenger-angels arrive to take their souls, asking them, “Where are those ˹false gods˺ you used to invoke besides Allah?” They will cry, “They have failed us,” and they will confess against themselves that they were indeed disbelievers.",
        "Allah will say, “Enter the Fire along with the ˹evil˺ groups of jinn and humans that preceded you.” Whenever a group enters Hell, it will curse the preceding one until they are all gathered inside, the followers will say about their leaders, “Our Lord! They have misled us, so multiply their torment in the Fire.” He will answer, “It has already been multiplied for all, but you do not know.”",
        "Then the leaders will say to their followers, “You were no better than us! So taste the torment for what you used to commit.”",
        "Surely those who receive our revelations with denial and arrogance, the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise until a camel passes through the eye of a needle. This is how We reward the wicked.",
        "Hell will be their bed; flames will be their cover. This is how We reward the wrongdoers.",
        "As for those who believe and do good—We never require of any soul more than what it can afford—it is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever.",
        "We will remove whatever bitterness they had in their hearts. Rivers will flow under their feet. And they will say, “Praise be to Allah for guiding us to this. We would have never been guided if Allah had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord had certainly come with the truth.” It will be announced to them, “This is Paradise awarded to you for what you used to do.”",
        "The residents of Paradise will call out to the residents of the Fire, “We have certainly found our Lord’s promise to be true. Have you too found your Lord’s promise to be true?” They will reply, “Yes, we have!” Then a caller will announce to both, “May Allah’s condemnation be upon the wrongdoers",
        "those who hindered ˹others˺ from Allah’s Way, strived to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, and disbelieved in the Hereafter.”",
        "There will be a barrier between Paradise and Hell. And on the heights ˹of that barrier˺ will be people who will recognize ˹the residents of˺ both by their appearance. They will call out to the residents of Paradise, “Peace be upon you!” They will have not yet entered Paradise, but eagerly hope to.",
        "When their eyes will turn towards the residents of Hell, they will pray, “Our Lord! Do not join us with the wrongdoing people.”",
        "Those on the heights will call out to some ˹tyrants in the Fire˺, who they will recognize by their appearance, saying, “Your large numbers and arrogance are of no use ˹today˺!",
        "Are these ˹humble believers˺ the ones you swore would never be shown Allah’s mercy?” ˹Finally, those on the heights will be told:˺ “Enter Paradise! There will be no fear for you, nor will you grieve.”",
        "The residents of the Fire will then cry out to the residents of Paradise, “Aid us with some water or any provision Allah has granted you.” They will reply, “Allah has forbidden both to the disbelievers",
        "those who took this faith ˹of Islam˺ as mere amusement and play and were deluded by ˹their˺ worldly life.” ˹Allah will say,˺ “Today We will ignore them just as they ignored the coming of this Day of theirs and for rejecting Our revelations.”",
        "We have certainly brought them a Book which We explained with knowledge—a guide and mercy for those who believe.",
        "Do they only await the fulfilment ˹of its warning˺? The Day it will be fulfilled, those who ignored it before will say, “The messengers of our Lord certainly came with the truth. Are there any intercessors who can plead on our behalf? Or can we be sent back so we may do ˹good,˺ unlike what we used to do?” They will have certainly ruined themselves, and whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them.",
        "Indeed your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then established Himself on the Throne. He makes the day and night overlap in rapid succession. He created the sun, the moon, and the stars—all subjected by His command. The creation and the command belong to Him ˹alone˺. Blessed is Allah—Lord of all worlds!",
        "Call upon your Lord humbly and secretly. Surely He does not like the transgressors.",
        "Do not spread corruption in the land after it has been set in order. And call upon Him with hope and fear. Indeed, Allah’s mercy is always close to the good-doers.",
        "He is the One Who sends the winds ushering in His mercy. When they bear heavy clouds, We drive them to a lifeless land and then cause rain to fall, producing every type of fruit. Similarly, We will bring the dead to life, so perhaps you will be mindful.",
        "The fertile land produces abundantly by the Will of its Lord, whereas the infertile land hardly produces anything. This is how We vary ˹Our˺ lessons to those who are thankful.",
        "Indeed, We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. I truly fear for you the torment of a tremendous Day.”",
        "But the chiefs of his people said, “We surely see that you are clearly misguided.”",
        "He replied, “O my people! I am not misguided! But I am a messenger from the Lord of all worlds",
        "conveying to you my Lord’s messages and giving you ˹sincere˺ advice. And I know from Allah what you do not know.",
        "Do you find it astonishing that a reminder should come to you from your Lord through one of your own, warning you, so you may beware and perhaps be shown mercy?”",
        "But they rejected him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and drowned those who rejected Our signs. They were certainly a blind people.",
        "And to the people of ’Âd We sent their brother Hûd. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. Will you not then fear Him?”",
        "The disbelieving chiefs of his people responded, “We surely see you as a fool, and we certainly think you are a liar.”",
        "Hûd replied, “O my people! I am no fool! But I am a messenger from the Lord of all worlds",
        "conveying to you my Lord’s messages. And I am your sincere advisor.",
        "Do you find it astonishing that a reminder should come to you from your Lord through one of your own so he may warn you? Remember that He made you successors after the people of Noah and increased you greatly in stature. So remember Allah’s favours, so you may be successful.”",
        "They said, “Have you come to us so that we would worship Allah alone and abandon what our forefathers used to worship? Then bring us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true!”",
        "He said, “You will certainly be subjected to your Lord’s torment and wrath. Do you dispute with me regarding the so-called gods which you and your forefathers have made up—a practice Allah has never authorized? Then wait! I too am waiting with you.”",
        "So We saved him and those with him by Our mercy and uprooted those who denied Our signs. They were not believers.",
        "And to the people of Thamûd We sent their brother Ṣâliḥ. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has come to you from your Lord: this is Allah’s she-camel as a sign to you. So leave her to graze ˹freely˺ on Allah’s land and do not harm her, or else you will be overcome by a painful punishment.",
        "Remember when He made you successors after ’Âd and established you in the land—˹and˺ you built palaces on its plains and carved homes into mountains. So remember Allah’s favours, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.”",
        "The arrogant chiefs of his people asked the lowly who believed among them, “Are you certain that Ṣâliḥ has been sent by his Lord?” They replied, “We certainly believe in what he has been sent with.”",
        "The arrogant said, “We surely reject what you believe in.”",
        "Then they killed the she-camel—defying their Lord’s command—and challenged ˹Ṣâliḥ˺, “Bring us what you threaten us with, if you are ˹truly˺ one of the messengers.”",
        "Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them, and they fell lifeless in their homes.",
        "So he turned away from them, saying, “O my people! Surely I conveyed to you my Lord’s message and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice, but you do not like ˹sincere˺ advisors.”",
        "And ˹remember˺ when Lot scolded ˹the men of˺ his people, ˹saying,˺ “Do you commit a shameful deed that no man has ever done before?",
        "You lust after men instead of women! You are certainly transgressors.”",
        "But his people’s only response was to say, “Expel them from your land! They are a people who wish to remain chaste!”",
        "So We saved him and his family except his wife, who was one of the doomed.",
        "We poured upon them a rain ˹of brimstone˺. See what was the end of the wicked!",
        "And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has already come to you from your Lord. So give just measure and weight, do not defraud people of their property, nor spread corruption in the land after it has been set in order. This is for your own good, if you are ˹truly˺ believers.",
        "And do not lie in ambush on every road—threatening and hindering those who believe in Allah from His Path and striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked. Remember when you were few, then He increased you in number. And consider the fate of the corruptors!",
        "If some of you do believe in what I have been sent with while others do not, then be patient until Allah judges between us. He is the Best of Judges.”",
        "The arrogant chiefs of his people threatened, “O Shu’aib! We will certainly expel you and your fellow believers from our land, unless you return to our faith.” He replied, “Even if we hate it?",
        "We would surely be fabricating a lie against Allah if we were to return to your faith after Allah has saved us from it. It does not befit us to return to it unless it is the Will of Allah, our Lord. Our Lord has encompassed everything in ˹His˺ knowledge. In Allah we trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people with truth. You are the best of those who judge.”",
        "The disbelieving chiefs of his people threatened, “If you follow Shu’aib, you will surely be losers!”",
        "Then an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes.",
        "Those who rejected Shu’aib were ˹wiped out˺ as if they had never lived there. Those who rejected Shu’aib were the true losers.",
        "He turned away from them, saying, “O my people! Indeed, I have delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you ˹sincere˺ advice. How can I then grieve for those who chose to disbelieve?”",
        "Whenever We sent a prophet to a society, We afflicted its ˹disbelieving˺ people with suffering and adversity, so perhaps they would be humbled.",
        "Then We changed their adversity to prosperity until they flourished and argued ˹falsely˺, “Our forefathers ˹too˺ had been visited by adversity and prosperity.” So We seized them by surprise, while they were unaware.",
        "Had the people of those societies been faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, We would have overwhelmed them with blessings from heaven and earth. But they disbelieved, so We seized them for what they used to commit.",
        "Did the people of those societies feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by night while they were asleep?",
        "Or did they feel secure that Our punishment would not come upon them by day while they were at play?",
        "Did they feel secure against Allah’s planning? None would feel secure from Allah’s planning except the losers.",
        "Is it not clear to those who take over the land after ˹the destruction of˺ its former residents that—if We will—We can punish them ˹too˺ for their sins and seal their hearts so they will not hear ˹the truth˺?",
        "We have narrated to you ˹O Prophet˺ some of the stories of those societies. Surely, their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but still they would not believe in what they had already denied. This is how Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers.",
        "We did not find most of them true to their covenant. Rather, We found most of them truly rebellious.",
        "Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. See what was the end of the corruptors!",
        "And Moses said, “O Pharaoh! I am truly a messenger from the Lord of all worlds",
        "obliged to say nothing about Allah except the truth. Indeed, I have come to you with clear proof from your Lord, so let the children of Israel go with me.”",
        "Pharaoh said, “If you have come with a sign, then bring it if what you say is true.”",
        "So Moses threw down his staff and—behold!—it became a real snake.",
        "Then he drew his hand ˹out of his collar˺ and it was ˹shining˺ white for all to see.",
        "The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, “He is indeed a skilled magician",
        "who seeks to drive you from your land.” ˹So Pharaoh asked,˺ “What do you propose?”",
        "They replied, “Let him and his brother wait and send mobilizers to all cities",
        "to bring you every clever magician.”",
        "The magicians came to Pharaoh, saying, “Shall we receive a ˹suitable˺ reward if we prevail?”",
        "He replied, “Yes, and you will certainly be among those closest to me.”",
        "They asked, “O Moses! Will you cast, or shall we be the first to cast?”",
        "Moses said, “You first.” So when they did, they deceived the eyes of the people, stunned them, and made a great display of magic.",
        "Then We inspired Moses, “Throw down your staff,” and—behold!—it devoured the objects of their illusion!",
        "So the truth prevailed and their illusions failed.",
        "So Pharaoh and his people were defeated right there and put to shame.",
        "And the magicians fell down, prostrating.",
        "They declared, “We ˹now˺ believe in the Lord of all worlds—",
        "the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”",
        "Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? This must be a conspiracy you devised in the city to drive out its people, but soon you will see.",
        "I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”",
        "They responded, “Surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return.",
        "Your rage towards us is only because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, and let us die while submitting ˹to You˺.”",
        "The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people protested, “Are you going to leave Moses and his people free to spread corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?” He responded, “We will kill their sons and keep their women. We will completely dominate them.”",
        "Moses reassured his people, “Seek Allah’s help and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah ˹alone˺. He grants it to whoever He chooses of His servants. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.”",
        "They complained, “We have always been oppressed—before and after you came to us ˹with the message˺.” He replied, “Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land to see what you will do.”",
        "Indeed, We afflicted Pharaoh’s people with famine and shortage of crops so they might come back ˹to their senses˺.",
        "In times of prosperity, they said, “This is what we deserve,” but in adversity, they blamed it on Moses and those with him. Surely all is destined by Allah. Yet most of them did not know.",
        "They said, “No matter what sign you may bring to deceive us, we will never believe in you.”",
        "So We plagued them with floods, locusts, lice, frogs, and blood—all as clear signs, but they persisted in arrogance and were a wicked people.",
        "When tormented, they pleaded, “O Moses! Pray to your Lord on our behalf, by virtue of the covenant He made with you. If you help remove this torment from us, we will certainly believe in you and let the Children of Israel go with you.”",
        "But as soon as We removed the torment from them—until they met their inevitable fate—they broke their promise.",
        "So We inflicted punishment upon them, drowning them in the sea for denying Our signs and being heedless of them.",
        "And ˹so˺ We made the oppressed people successors of the eastern and western lands, which We had showered with blessings. ˹In this way˺ the noble Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel for what they had endured. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people constructed and what they established.",
        "We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came upon a people devoted to idols. They demanded, “O Moses! Make for us a god like their gods.” He replied, “Indeed, you are a people acting ignorantly!",
        "What they follow is certainly doomed to destruction and their deeds are in vain.”",
        "He added, “Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, while He has honoured you above the others?”",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We rescued you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment—killing your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.",
        "We appointed for Moses thirty nights then added another ten—completing his Lord’s term of forty nights. Moses commanded his brother Aaron, “Take my place among my people, do what is right, and do not follow the way of the corruptors.”",
        "When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, “My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me so I may see You.” Allah answered, “You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He levelled it to dust and Moses collapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.”",
        "Allah said, “O Moses! I have ˹already˺ elevated you above all others by My messages and speech. So hold firmly to what I have given you and be grateful.”",
        "We wrote for him on the Tablets ˹the fundamentals˺ of everything; commandments and explanations of all things. ˹We commanded,˺ “Hold to this firmly and ask your people to take the best of it. I will soon show ˹all of˺ you the home of the rebellious.",
        "I will turn away from My signs those who act unjustly with arrogance in the land. And even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. If they see the Right Path, they will not take it. But if they see a crooked path, they will follow it. This is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.",
        "The deeds of those who deny Our signs and the meeting ˹with Allah˺ in the Hereafter will be in vain. Will they be rewarded except for what they have done?”",
        "In the absence of Moses, his people made from their ˹golden˺ jewellery an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the ˹Right˺ Path? Still they took it as a god and were wrongdoers.",
        "Later, when they were filled with remorse and realized they had gone astray, they cried, “If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will certainly be losers.”",
        "Upon Moses’ return to his people, ˹totally˺ furious and sorrowful, he said, “What an evil thing you committed in my absence! Did you want to hasten your Lord’s torment?” Then he threw down the Tablets and grabbed his brother by the hair, dragging him closer. Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and were about to kill me. So do not ˹humiliate me and˺ make my enemies rejoice, nor count me among the wrongdoing people.”",
        "Moses prayed, “My Lord! Forgive me and my brother! And admit us into Your mercy. You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”",
        "Those who worshipped the calf will certainly be afflicted with Allah’s wrath as well as disgrace in the life of this world. This is how We reward those who invent falsehood.",
        "But those who commit evil, then repent and become ˹true˺ believers, your Lord will certainly be All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.",
        "When Moses’ anger subsided, he took up the Tablets whose text contained guidance and mercy for those who stand in awe of their Lord.",
        "Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment and, when they were seized by an earthquake, he cried, “My Lord! Had You willed, You could have destroyed them long ago, and me as well. Will You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is only a test from You—by which You allow whoever you will to stray and guide whoever You will. You are our Guardian. So forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the best forgiver.",
        "Ordain for us what is good in this life and the next. Indeed, we have turned to You ˹in repentance˺.” Allah replied, “I will inflict My torment on whoever I will. But My mercy encompasses everything. I will ordain mercy for those who shun evil, pay alms-tax, and believe in Our revelations.",
        "“˹They are˺ the ones who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whose description they find in their Torah and the Gospel. He commands them to do good and forbids them from evil, permits for them what is lawful and forbids to them what is impure, and relieves them from their burdens and the shackles that bound them. ˹Only˺ those who believe in him, honour and support him, and follow the light sent down to him will be successful.”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! I am Allah’s Messenger to you all. To Him ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He gives life and causes death.” So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in Allah and His revelations. And follow him, so you may be ˹rightly˺ guided.",
        "There are some among the people of Moses who guide with the truth and establish justice accordingly.",
        "We divided them into twelve tribes—each as a community. And We revealed to Moses, when his people asked for water, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out. Each tribe knew its drinking place. We shaded them with clouds and sent down to them manna and quails, ˹saying˺, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” They ˹certainly˺ did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when it was said to them, “Enter this city ˹of Jerusalem˺ and eat from wherever you please. Say, ‘Absolve us,’ and enter the gate with humility. We will forgive your sins, ˹and˺ We will multiply the reward for the good-doers.”",
        "But the wrongdoers among them changed the words they were commanded to say. So We sent down a punishment from the heavens upon them for their wrongdoing.",
        "Ask them ˹O Prophet˺ about ˹the people of˺ the town which was by the sea, who broke the Sabbath. During the Sabbath, ˹abundant˺ fish would come to them clearly visible, but on other days the fish were never seen. In this way We tested them for their rebelliousness.",
        "When some of ˹the righteous among˺ them questioned ˹their fellow Sabbath-keepers˺, “Why do you ˹bother to˺ warn those ˹Sabbath-breakers˺ who will either be destroyed or severely punished by Allah?” They replied, “Just to be free from your Lord’s blame, and so perhaps they may abstain.”",
        "When they ignored the warning they were given, We rescued those who used to warn against evil and overtook the wrongdoers with a dreadful punishment for their rebelliousness.",
        "But when they stubbornly persisted in violation, We said to them, “Be disgraced apes!”",
        "And ˹remember, O  Prophet,˺ when your Lord declared that He would send against them others who would make them suffer terribly until the Day of Judgment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in punishment, but He is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "We dispersed them through the land in groups—some were righteous, others were less so. We tested them with prosperity and adversity, so perhaps they would return ˹to the Right Path˺.",
        "Then they were succeeded by other generations who inherited the Scripture. They indulged in unlawful gains, claiming, “We will be forgiven ˹after all˺.” And if similar gain came their way, they would seize it. Was a covenant not taken from them in the Scripture that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they were already well-versed in its teachings. But the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand?",
        "As for those who firmly abide by the Scripture and establish prayer—surely We never discount the reward of those acting righteously.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We raised the mountain over them as if it were a cloud and they thought it would fall on them. ˹We said,˺ “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become mindful ˹of Allah˺.”",
        "And ˹remember˺ when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their descendants and had them testify regarding themselves. ˹Allah asked,˺ “Am I not your Lord?” They replied, “Yes, You are! We testify.” ˹He cautioned,˺ “Now you have no right to say on Judgment Day, ‘We were not aware of this.’",
        "Nor say, ‘It was our forefathers who had associated others ˹with Allah in worship˺ and we, as their descendants, followed in their footsteps. Will you then destroy us for the falsehood they invented?’”",
        "This is how We make our signs clear, so perhaps they will return ˹to the Right Path˺.",
        "And relate to them ˹O Prophet˺ the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he abandoned them, so Satan took hold of him, and he became a deviant.",
        "If We had willed, We would have elevated him with Our signs, but he clung to this life—following his evil desires. His example is that of a dog: if you chase it away, it pants, and if you leave it, it ˹still˺ pants. This is the example of the people who deny Our signs. So narrate ˹to them˺ stories ˹of the past˺, so perhaps they will reflect.",
        "What an evil example of those who denied Our signs! They ˹only˺ wronged their own souls.",
        "Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. And whoever He leaves to stray, they are the ˹true˺ losers.",
        "Indeed, We have destined many jinn and humans for Hell. They have hearts they do not understand with, eyes they do not see with, and ears they do not hear with. They are like cattle. In fact, they are even less guided! Such ˹people˺ are ˹entirely˺ heedless.",
        "Allah has the Most Beautiful Names. So call upon Him by them, and keep away from those who abuse His Names. They will be punished for what they used to do.",
        "And among those We created is a group that guides with the truth and establishes justice accordingly.",
        "As for those who deny Our signs, We will gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot comprehend.",
        "I ˹only˺ delay their end for a while, but My planning is flawless.",
        "Have they not ever given it a thought? Their fellow man is not insane. He is only sent with a clear warning.",
        "Have they ever reflected on the wonders of the heavens and the earth, and everything Allah has created, and that perhaps their end is near? So what message after this ˹Quran˺ would they believe in?",
        "Whoever Allah allows to stray, none can guide, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance.",
        "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ regarding the Hour, “When will it be?” Say, “That knowledge is only with my Lord. He alone will reveal it when the time comes. It is too tremendous for the heavens and the earth and will only take you by surprise.” They ask you as if you had full knowledge of it. Say, “That knowledge is only with Allah, but most people do not know.”",
        "Say, “I have no power to benefit or protect myself, except by the Will of Allah. If I had known the unknown, I would have benefited myself enormously, and no harm would have ever touched me. I am only a warner and deliverer of good news for those who believe.”",
        "He is the One Who created you from a single soul, then from it made its spouse so he may find comfort in her. After he had been united with her, she carried a light burden that developed gradually. When it grew heavy, they prayed to Allah, their Lord, “If you grant us good offspring, we will certainly be grateful.”",
        "But when He granted their descendants good offspring, they associated false gods in what He has given them. Exalted is Allah above what they associate ˹with Him˺!",
        "Do they associate ˹with Allah˺ those ˹idols˺ which cannot create anything, but are in fact created;",
        "which cannot help them, or even help themselves?",
        "And if you ˹idolaters˺ call upon them for guidance, they cannot respond to you. It is all the same whether you call them or remain silent.",
        "Those ˹idols˺ you invoke besides Allah are created beings like yourselves. So call upon them and see if they will answer you, if your claims are true!",
        "Do they have feet to walk with? Or hands to hold with? Or eyes to see with? Or ears to hear with? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Call upon your associate-gods and conspire against me without delay!",
        "“Indeed, my Protector is Allah Who has revealed this Book. For He ˹alone˺ protects the righteous.",
        "But those ˹false gods˺ you call besides Him can neither help you nor even themselves.”",
        "If you ˹idolaters˺ call them to guidance, they cannot hear. And you ˹O Prophet˺ may see them facing towards you, but they cannot see.",
        "Be gracious, enjoin what is right, and turn away from those who act ignorantly.",
        "If you are tempted by Satan, then seek refuge with Allah. Surely He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "Indeed, when Satan whispers to those mindful ˹of Allah˺, they remember ˹their Lord˺ then they start to see ˹things˺ clearly.",
        "But the devils persistently plunge their ˹human˺ associates deeper into wickedness, sparing no effort.",
        "If you ˹O Prophet˺ do not bring them a sign ˹which they demanded˺, they ask, “Why do you not make it yourself?” Say, “I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This ˹Quran˺ is an insight from your Lord—a guide and a mercy for those who believe.”",
        "When the Quran is recited, listen to it attentively and be silent, so you may be shown mercy.",
        "Remember your Lord inwardly with humility and reverence and in a moderate tone of voice, both morning and evening. And do not be one of the heedless.",
        "Surely those ˹angels˺ nearest to your Lord are not too proud to worship Him. They glorify Him. And to Him they prostrate."

        "আর যদি জনপদসমূহের অধিবাসীরা ঈমান আনত এবং তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করত তাহলে আমি অবশ্যই আসমান ও যমীন থেকে বরকতসমূহ তাদের উপর খুলে দিতাম; কিন্তু তারা অস্বীকার করল। অতঃপর তারা যা অর্জন করত তার কারণে আমি তাদেরকে পাকড়াও করলাম।",
        "জনপদগুলোর অধিবাসীরা কি রাতের বেলা তাদের কাছে আমার আযাব এসে যাওয়া থেকে নিরাপদ হয়ে গিয়েছে যখন তারা ঘুমিয়ে থাকবে?",
        "অথবা জনপদগুলোর অধিবাসীরা কি দ্বিপ্রহরে তাদের কাছে আমার আযাব এসে যাওয়া থেকে নিরাপদ হয়ে গিয়েছে যখন তারা খেলা-ধুলা করতে থাকবে?",
        "তারা কি আল্লাহর কৌশল থেকে নিরাপদ হয়ে গিয়েছে? বস্তুত ক্ষতিগ্রস্ত কওম ছাড়া আল্লাহর কৌশল থেকে আর কেউ (নিজদেরকে) নিরাপদ মনে করে না।",
        "যমীনের অধিবাসীদের (চলে যাবার) পর যারা তার উত্তরাধিকারী হয়, তাদের কাছে কি এ কথা পরিষ্কার হয়নি যে, আমি যদি চাই, তাদের পাপের কারণে তাদেরকে শাস্তি দিতে পারি? আর আমি মোহর মেরে দেই তাদের হৃদয়ে। অতঃপর তারা শোনে না।",
        "এ হল সে সব জনপদ, যার কিছু কাহিনী আমি তোমার কাছে বর্ণনা করছি। আর তাদের কাছে তো স্পষ্ট প্রমাণাদিসহ তাদের রাসূলগণ এসেছিল। কিন্তু যা তারা পূর্বে অস্বীকার করেছিল তার প্রতি তারা ঈমান আনার ছিল না। এমনিভাবে আল্লাহ কাফিরদের অন্তরে মোহর মেরে দেন।",
        "আর তাদের অধিকাংশ লোককে আমি অঙ্গীকার রক্ষাকারী পাইনি। বরং তাদের অধিকাংশকে আমি ফাসিক-ই পেয়েছি।",
        "অতঃপর তাদের পরে আমি মূসাকে আমার আয়াতসমূহ সহকারে ফির‘আউন ও তার সভাসদদের কাছে পাঠিয়েছি। অতঃপর তারা এর সাথে যুলম করেছে। সুতরাং লক্ষ্য কর, ফাসাদকারীদের পরিণাম কীরূপ হয়েছিল।",
        "মূসা বলল, ‘হে ফির‘আউন, আমি তো সকল সৃষ্টির রবের পক্ষ থেকে রাসূল।’",
        "সমীচীন যে, আমি আল্লাহ সম্পর্কে সত্য ছাড়া বলব না। আমি তোমাদের রবের নিকট থেকে স্পষ্ট প্রমাণ নিয়ে তোমাদের কাছে এসেছি। সুতরাং তুমি বনী ইসরাঈলকে আমার সাথে পাঠিয়ে দাও।’",
        "সে বলল, ‘তুমি যদি কোন আয়াত নিয়ে আস তবে তা পেশ কর, যদি তুমি সত্যবাদীদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হও।’",
        "তখন সে ছেড়ে দিল তার লাঠি। তৎক্ষণাৎ তা এক স্পষ্ট অজগর হয়ে গেল।",
        "আর সে বের করল তার হাত, তৎক্ষণাৎ তা দর্শকদের কাছে ধবধবে সাদা (দেখাচ্ছিল)।",
        "ফির‘আউনের কওমের সভাসদরা বলল, ‘নিশ্চয় এ হল বিজ্ঞ যাদুকর।’",

        "‘তারা আপনার কাছে সকল বিজ্ঞ যাদুকরকে নিয়ে আসবে।’",
        "আর যাদুকররা ফির‘আউনের কাছে আসল। তারা বলল, ‘নিশ্চয় আমাদের জন্য পারিশ্রমিক আছে, যদি আমরা বিজয়ী হই?’",
        "সে বলল, ‘হ্যাঁ, আর অবশ্যই তোমরা আমার ঘনিষ্ঠ লোকদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হবে।’",
        "তারা বলল, ‘হে মূসা, হয় তুমি নিক্ষেপ করবে, নয়তো আমরাই নিক্ষেপ করব।’",
        "সে বলল, ‘তোমরা নিক্ষেপ কর।’ অতঃপর যখন তারা নিক্ষেপ করল তখন তারা লোকদের চোখে যাদু করল এবং তাদেরকে ভীত করে তুলল। তারা বড় যাদু প্রদর্শন করল।",
        "আর আমি মূসার প্রতি ওহী পাঠালাম যে, ‘তুমি তোমার লাঠি ছেড়ে দাও’ তৎক্ষণাৎ সে গিলতে লাগল সেগুলিকে যে অলীক বস্তু তারা বানিয়েছিল।",
        "ফলে সত্য প্রকাশ হয়ে গেল এবং তারা যা কিছু করছিল তা বাতিল হয়ে গেল।",
        "তাই সেখানে তারা পরাজিত হল এবং লাঞ্ছিত হয়ে গেল।",
        "আর যাদুকররা সিজদায় পড়ে গেল।",
        "তারা বলল, ‘আমরা সকল সৃষ্টির রবের প্রতি ঈমান আনলাম,",

        "আমি অবশ্যই তোমাদের হাত ও পা বিপরীত দিক থেকে কেটে দেব। তারপর অবশ্যই তোমাদের সবাইকে শূলে চড়াব।’",

        "আর ফির‘আউনের কওমের সভাসদগণ বলল, ‘আপনি কি মূসা ও তার কওমকে ছেড়ে দেবেন যাতে তারা যমীনে ফাসাদ করে এবং আপনাকে ও আপনার উপাস্যগুলোকে বর্জন করে?’ সে বলল, ‘আমরা অতিসত্বর তাদের ছেলেদেরকে হত্যা করব আর মেয়েদেরকে জীবিত রাখব। আর নিশ্চয় আমরা তাদের উপর ক্ষমতাবান।’",
        "মূসা তার কওমকে বলল, ‘আল্লাহর কাছে সাহায্য চাও এবং ধৈর্য ধারণ কর। নিশ্চয় যমীন আল্লাহর। তাঁর বান্দাদের মধ্যে যাকে তিনি চান তাকে তার উত্তরাধিকারী বানিয়ে দেন। আর পরিণাম মুত্তাকীদের জন্য।’",
        "তারা বলল, ‘তুমি আমাদের কাছে আসার পূর্বে আমাদেরকে কষ্ট দেয়া হয়েছে এবং তুমি আমাদের কাছে আসার পরেও।’ সে বলল, ‘আশা করা যায়, তোমাদের রব তোমাদের শত্রুকে ধ্বংস করবেন এবং যমীনে তোমাদেরকে স্থলাভিষিক্ত করবেন, অতঃপর তিনি দেখবেন তোমরা কীভাবে আমল কর।’",
        "আর আমি পাকড়াও করেছি ফির‘আউনের অনুসারীদেরকে দুর্ভিক্ষ ও ফল- ফলাদির ক্ষয়-ক্ষতির মাধ্যমে, যাতে তারা উপদেশ গ্রহণ করে।",
        "অতঃপর যখন তাদের কাছে কল্যাণ আসত, তখন তারা বলত, ‘এটা আমাদের জন্য।’ আর যখন তাদের কাছে অকল্যাণ পৌঁছত তখন তারা মূসা ও তার সঙ্গীদেরকে অশুভলক্ষুণে মনে করত। তাদের কল্যাণ-অকল্যাণ তো আল্লাহর কাছে। কিন্তু তাদের অধিকাংশ জানে না।",
        "আর তারা বলল, ‘তুমি আমাদেরকে যাদু করার জন্য যে কোন নিদর্শন আমাদের কাছে নিয়ে আস না কেন আমরা তো তোমার প্রতি ঈমান আনব না।’",
        "সুতরাং আমি তাদের বিরুদ্ধে বিস্তারিত নিদর্শনাবলী হিসাবে পাঠালাম তুফান, পঙ্গপাল, উকুন, ব্যাঙ ও রক্ত। তার পরেও তারা অহঙ্কার করল। আর তারা ছিল এক অপরাধী কওম।",
        "আর যখন তাদের উপর আযাব পতিত হল তখন তারা বলল, ‘হে মূসা আমাদের জন্য তুমি তোমার রবের কাছে দুআ কর তিনি যে ওয়াদা তোমার সাথে করেছেন সে অনুযায়ী। যদি তুমি আমাদের উপর থেকে আযাব সরিয়ে দাও তাহলে অবশ্যই আমরা তোমার প্রতি ঈমান আনব এবং অবশ্যই তোমার সাথে বনী ইসরাঈলকে পাঠিয়ে দেব।’",
        "অতঃপর যখনই আমি তাদের থেকে আযাব সরিয়ে নিতাম কিছু কালের জন্য যা তাদের জন্য নির্ধারিত ছিল, তখনই তারা অঙ্গীকার ভঙ্গ করত।",
        "অতঃপর আমি তাদের থেকে প্রতিশোধ নিলাম, ফলে তাদেরকে সমুদ্রে ডুবিয়ে দিলাম। কারণ তারা আমার আয়াতসমূহকে অস্বীকার করেছে এবং এ সম্পর্কে তারা ছিল গাফেল ।",

        "আর বনী ইসরাঈলকে আমি সমুদ্র পার করিয়ে দিলাম। অতঃপর তারা আসল এমন এক কওমের কাছে যারা নিজদের মূর্তিগুলোর পূজায় রত ছিল। তারা বলল, ‘হে মূসা, তাদের যেমন উপাস্য আছে আমাদের জন্য তেমনি উপাস্য নির্ধারণ করে দাও। সে বলল, ‘নিশ্চয় তোমরা এমন এক কওম যারা মূর্খ’।",
        "নিশ্চয় এরা যাতে আছে, তা ধ্বংসশীল এবং তারা যা করত তা বাতিল।",

        "আর স্মরণ কর, যখন আমি ফির‘আউনের লোকদের থেকে তোমাদেরকে রক্ষা করলাম, যারা তোমাদের নিকৃষ্ট শাস্তি দিত। যারা তোমাদের ছেলেদের হত্যা করত এবং নারীদের জীবিত রাখত। এতে ছিল তোমাদের রবের পক্ষ থেকে এক মহাপরীক্ষা।",
        "আর স্মরণ কর, ‘আমি মূসাকে ত্রিশ রাতের ওয়াদা দিয়েছিলাম এবং আরো দশ দ্বারা তা পূর্ণ করেছিলাম। সুতরাং তার রবের নির্ধারিত মেয়াদ চলি¬শ রাত পূর্ণ হল এবং মূসা তার ভাই হারূনকে বলল, ‘আমার কওমের মধ্যে তুমি আমার প্রতিনিধিত্ব কর, সংশোধন কর এবং ফাসাদকারীদের পথ অনুসরণ করো না’।",
        "আর যখন আমার নির্ধারিত সময়ে মূসা এসে গেল এবং তার রব তার সাথে কথা বললেন। সে বলল, ‘হে আমার রব, আপনি আমাকে দেখা দিন, আমি আপনাকে দেখব।’ তিনি বললেন, তুমি আমাকে কখনো দেখবে না। বরং তুমি পাহাড়ের দিকে তাকাও, অতঃপর তা যদি নিজ স্থানে স্থির থাকে তবে তুমি অচিরেই আমাকে দেখবে। অতঃপর যখন তার রব পাহাড়ের উপর নূর প্রকাশ করলেন তখন তা তাকে চূর্ণ করে দিল এবং মূসা বেহুঁশ হয়ে পড়ে গেল। অতঃপর যখন তার হুঁশ আসল তখন সে বলল, ‘আপনি পবিত্র মহান, আমি আপনার নিকট তাওবা করলাম এবং আমি মুমিনদের মধ্যে প্রথম।’",
        "তিনি বললেন, ‘হে মূসা, আমি আমার রিসালাত ও বাক্যালাপ দ্বারা তোমাকে মানুষের উপর বেছে নিয়েছি। সুতরাং যা কিছু আমি তোমাকে প্রদান করলাম তা গ্রহণ কর এবং শোকর আদায়কারীদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হও।’",

        "যারা অন্যায়ভাবে যমীনে অহঙ্কার করে আমার আয়াতসমূহ থেকে তাদেরকে আমি অবশ্যই ফিরিয়ে রাখব। আর তারা সকল আয়াত দেখলেও তাতে ঈমান আনবে না এবং তারা সঠিক পথ দেখলেও তাকে পথ হিসাবে গ্রহণ করবে না। আর তারা ভ্রান্ত পথ দেখলে তা পথ হিসাবে গ্রহণ করবে। এটা এ জন্য যে, তারা আমার আয়াতসমূহকে অস্বীকার করেছে এবং সে সম্পর্কে তারা ছিল গাফেল।",
        "আর যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহ ও আখিরাতের সাক্ষাতকে অস্বীকার করেছে তাদের কর্মসমূহ বিনষ্ট হয়ে গেছে। তারা যা করে তদনুযায়ী তাদের প্রতিদান দেয়া হবে।",
        "আর মূসার কওম তার (বের হওয়ার) পরে তাদের অলংকারাদি দিয়ে বানিয়ে নিল একটি গো বাছুর- দেহ, তার ছিল গরুর আওয়ায। তারা কি দেখল না যে, এটা তো তাদের সাথে কথা বলে না এবং তাদের পথ দেখায় না? তারা তাকে গ্রহণ করল এবং তারা ছিল যালিম।",
        "আর যখন তারা অনুতপ্ত হল এবং দেখল যে, তারা তো পথভ্রষ্ট হয়েছে, তখন তারা বলল, ‘যদি আমাদের রব আমাদের প্রতি রহম না করেন এবং আমাদেরকে ক্ষমা না করেন তবে অবশ্যই আমরা ক্ষতিগ্রস্তদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হব’।",
        "আর মূসা যখন নিজ কওমের কাছে ফিরে আসল রাগান্বিত বিক্ষুদ্ধ অবস্থায়, তখন বলল, ‘আমার পরে তোমরা আমার কত খারাপ প্রতিনিধিত্ব করেছ! তোমাদের রবের নির্দেশের পূর্বে তোমরা তাড়াহুড়া করলে?’ আর সে ফলকগুলো ফেলে দিল এবং স্বীয় ভাইয়ের মাথা ধরে নিজের দিকে টেনে আনতে লাগল। সে বলল, ‘হে আমার মায়ের পুত্র, এ জাতি আমাকে দুর্বল মনে করেছে এবং আমাকে হত্যা করতে উদ্যত হয়েছে, তাই তুমি আমার ব্যাপারে শত্রুদেরকে আনন্দিত করো না এবং আমাকে যালিম কওমের অন্তর্ভুক্ত করো না।",
        "সে বলল, ‘আমার রব, ক্ষমা করুন আমাকে ও আমার ভাইকে এবং আপনার রহমতে আমাদের প্রবেশ করান। আর আপনিই রহমকারীদের মধ্যে শ্রেষ্ঠ।",
        "নিশ্চয় যারা গো বাছুরকে (উপাস্য হিসাবে) গ্রহণ করেছে, দুনিয়ার জীবনে তাদেরকে আক্রান্ত করবে তাদের রবের পক্ষ থেকে গযব ও লাঞ্ছনা। আর এভাবে আমি মিথ্যা রটনাকারীদের প্রতিফল দেই।",
        "আর যারা খারাপ কাজ করল, তারপর তাওবা করল এবং ঈমান আনল, নিশ্চয় তোমার রব এরপরও ক্ষমাশীল, পরম দয়ালু।",
        "আর যখন মূসার ক্রোধ থেমে গেল তখন সে ফলকগুলো তুলে নিল। তার লেখাতে ছিল হিদায়াত ও রহমত, তাদের জন্য যারা নিজদের রবকেই ভয় করে।",
        "আর মূসা নিজ কওম থেকে সত্তর জন লোককে আমার নির্ধারিত স্থানের জন্য নির্বাচন করল। অতঃপর যখন ভূমিকম্প তাদেরকে পাকড়াও করল তখন সে বলল, ‘হে আমার রব, আপনি চাইলে ইতঃপূর্বে এদের ধ্বংস করতে পারতেন এবং আমাকেও। আমাদের মধ্যে নির্বোধরা যা করেছে তার কারণে কি আমাদেরকে ধ্বংস করবেন? এটাতো আপনার পরীক্ষা ছাড়া কিছু না। এর মাধ্যমে যাকে চান আপনি পথভ্রষ্ট করেন এবং যাকে চান হিদায়াত দান করেন। আপনি আমাদের অভিভাবক। সুতরাং আমাদের ক্ষমা করে দিন এবং আপনি উত্তম ক্ষমাশীল।",
        "আর আমাদের জন্য এ দুনিয়াতে ও আখিরাতে কল্যাণ লিখে দিন। নিশ্চয় আমরা আপনার দিকে প্রত্যাবর্তন করেছি।’ তিনি বললেন, ‘আমি যাকে চাই তাকে আমার আযাব দেই। আর আমার রহমত সব বস্তুকে পরিব্যাপ্ত করেছে। সুতরাং আমি তা লিখে দেব তাদের জন্য যারা তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করে এবং যাকাত প্রদান করে। আর যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহের প্রতি ঈমান আনে।",

        "আর স্মরণ কর, যখন তাদেরকে বলা হল, ‘তোমরা এ জনপদে* বসবাস কর এবং যেখানে চাও সেখান থেকে আহার কর এবং বল ‘হিত্তাহ’** । আর অবনত মস্তকে দরজায় প্রবেশ কর। আমি তোমাদের অপরাধগুলো ক্ষমা করে দেব। অবশ্যই আমি সৎকর্মশীলদেরকে বাড়িয়ে দেব।’ \n* বাইতুল মুকাদ্দাস অঞ্চল।",
        "অতঃপর তাদের মধ্য থেকে যারা যুলম করেছিল, তাদেরকে যা বলা হয়েছিল তার পরিবর্তে তারা অন্য কথা বলল। ফলে আমি আসমান থেকে তাদের উপর শাস্তি পাঠালাম, কারণ তারা যুলম করত।",
        "আর তাদের কাছে জিজ্ঞেস কর সাগরের নিকটে অবস্থিত জনপদটি* সম্পর্কে, যখন তারা শনিবারে সীমালংঘন করত। যখন তাদের কাছে শনিবারে তাদের মাছগুলো ভেসে আসত। আর যেদিন তারা শনিবার যাপন করত না, সেদিন তাদের কাছে আসত না। এভাবে আমি তাদেরকে পরীক্ষা করতাম। কারণ তারা পাপাচার করত। \n* লোহিত সাগর তীরবর্তী ‘আয়লা’ নামক জনপদ।",
        "আর স্মরণ কর, যখন তাদের একদল বলল, ‘তোমরা কেন উপদেশ দিচ্ছ এমন কওমকে, যাদেরকে আল্লাহ ধ্বংস করবেন অথবা কঠিন আযাব দেবেন’? তারা বলল, ‘তোমাদের রবের নিকট ওযর পেশ করার উদ্দেশ্যে। আশা করা যায় তারা সাবধান হবে’।",
        "অতঃপর যে উপদেশ তাদেরকে দেয়া হয়েছিল, যখন তারা তা ভুলে গেল তখন আমি মুক্তি দিলাম তাদেরকে যারা মন্দ হতে নিষেধ করে। আর যারা যুলম করেছে তাদেরকে কঠিন আযাব দ্বারা পাকড়াও করলাম। কারণ, তারা পাপাচার করত।",
        "অতঃপর যা থেকে তাদেরকে নিষেধ করা হয়েছিল তারা যখন সে বিষয়ে সীমালঙ্ঘন করল, তখন আমি তাদেরকে বললাম, ‘তোমরা নিকৃষ্ট বানর হয়ে যাও’।",

        "আর যমীনে আমি তাদেরকে বিভক্ত করেছি বিভিন্ন জাতিতে। তাদের কেউ নেককার আর কেউ অন্যরূপ এবং আমি তাদেরকে পরীক্ষা করেছি ভাল ও মন্দ দ্বারা, হয়তো তারা ফিরে আসবে।",
        "অতঃপর তাদের পরে স্থলাভিষিক্ত হয়েছে এমন বংশধর যারা কিতাবের উত্তরাধিকারী হয়েছে, তারা এ নগণ্য (দুনিয়ার) সামগ্রী গ্রহণ করে এবং বলে, ‘শীঘ্রই আমাদের ক্ষমা করে দেয়া হবে’। বস্তুত যদি তার অনুরূপ সামগ্রী (আবারও) তাদের নিকট আসে তবে তারা তা গ্রহণ করবে। তাদের কাছ থেকে কি কিতাবের অঙ্গীকার নেয়া হয়নি যে, তারা আল্লাহর ব্যাপারে সত্য ছাড়া বলবে না? আর তারা এতে যা আছে, তা পাঠ করেছে এবং আখিরাতের আবাস তাদের জন্য উত্তম, যারা তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করে। তোমরা কি বুঝ না?",
        "আর যারা কিতাবকে দৃঢ়ভাবে আঁকড়ে ধরে এবং সালাত কায়েম করে, নিশ্চয় আমি সৎকর্মশীলদের প্রতিদান বিনষ্ট’ করি না।",
        "আর স্মরণ কর, যখন আমি তাদের উপর পাহাড় তুলে ধরলাম, যেন তা একখন্ড মেঘ এবং তারা মনে করল যে, নিশ্চয় তা তাদের উপর পড়বে। ‘আমি তোমাদের যা দিয়েছি, তা শক্তভাবে ধর এবং তাতে যা আছে তা স্মরণ কর, যেন তোমরা তাকওয়া অবলম্বন করতে পার।’",
        "আর স্মরণ কর, যখন তোমার রব বনী-আদমের পৃষ্ঠদেশ হতে তাদের বংশধরকে বের করলেন এবং তাদেরকে তাদের নিজদের উপর সাক্ষী করলেন যে, ‘আমি কি তোমাদের রব নই’? তারা বলল, ‘হ্যাঁ, আমরা সাক্ষ্য দিলাম।’ যাতে কিয়ামতের দিন তোমরা বলতে না পার যে, নিশ্চয় আমরা এ বিষয়ে অনবহিত ছিলাম।",
        "অথবা তোমরা যাতে বলতে না পার, ‘আমাদের পিতৃ-পুরুষরাই পূর্বে শির্ক করেছে, আর আমরা ছিলাম তাদের পরবর্তী বংশধর। সুতরাং বাতিলপন্থিরা যা করেছে, তার কারণে আপনি কি আমাদেরকে ধ্বংস করবেন’?",
        "আর এভাবেই আমি আয়াতসমূহ বিস্তারিত বর্ণনা করি, যাতে তারা ফিরে আসে।",
        "আর তুমি তাদের উপর সে ব্যক্তির সংবাদ পাঠ কর, যাকে আমি আমার আয়াতসমূহ দিয়েছিলাম। অতঃপর সে তা হতে বিচ্ছিন্ন হয়ে গিয়েছিল এবং শয়তান তার পেছনে লেগেছিল। ফলে সে বিপথগামীদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হয়ে গিয়েছিল।",
        "আর আমি ইচ্ছা করলে উক্ত নিদর্শনাবলীর মাধ্যমে তাকে অবশ্যই উচ্চ মর্যাদা দিতাম, কিন্তু সে পৃথিবীর প্রতি ঝুঁকে পড়েছে এবং নিজ প্রবৃত্তির অনুসরণ করেছে। সুতরাং তার দৃষ্টান্ত হচ্ছে কুকুরের মত। যদি তার উপর বোঝা চাপিয়ে দাও তাহলে সে জিহবা বের করে হাঁপাবে অথবা যদি তাকে ছেড়ে দাও তাহলেও সে জিহবা বের করে হাঁপাবে। এটি হচ্ছে সে কওমের দৃষ্টান্ত যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহকে অস্বীকার করেছে। অতএব তুমি কাহিনী বর্ণনা কর, যাতে তারা চিন্তা করে।",
        "উপমা হিসাবে খুবই মন্দ সে কওম যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহকে অস্বীকার করেছে এবং তারা নিজদের প্রতিই যুলম করত।",

        "আর আল্লাহর জন্যই রয়েছে সুন্দরতম নামসমূহ। সুতরাং তোমরা তাঁকে সেসব নামেই ডাক। আর তাদেরকে বর্জন কর যারা তাঁর নামে বিকৃতি ঘটায়। তারা যা করত অচিরেই তাদেরকে তার প্রতিফল দেয়া হবে।",
        "আর যাদেরকে আমি সৃষ্টি করেছি তাদের মধ্যে এমন একদল আছে যারা যথাযথভাবে পথ দেখায় এবং তদ্বারা ইনসাফ করে।",

        "আর আমি তাদেরকে অবকাশ দিচ্ছি। নিশ্চয় আমার কৌশল শক্তিশালী।",

        "তারা কি দৃষ্টিপাত করেনি আসমানসমূহ ও যমীনের রাজত্বে এবং আল্লাহ যা কিছু সৃষ্টি করেছেন তার প্রতি? আর (এর প্রতি যে) হয়তো তাদের নির্দিষ্ট সময় নিকটে এসে গিয়েছে? সুতরাং তারা এরপর আর কোন্ কথার প্রতি ঈমান আনবে?",
        "আল্লাহ যাকে পথভ্রষ্ট করেন তার কোন হিদায়াতকারী নেই এবং তিনি তাদেরকে তাদের অবাধ্যতায় ছেড়ে দেন, তারা দিশেহারা হয়ে ঘুরে বেড়ায়।",
        "তারা তোমাকে কিয়ামত সম্পর্কে প্রশ্ন করে, ‘তা কখন ঘটবে’? তুমি বল, ‘এর জ্ঞান তো রয়েছে আমার রবের নিকট। তিনিই এর নির্ধারিত সময়ে তা প্রকাশ করবেন। আসমানসমূহ ও যমীনের উপর তা (কিয়ামত) কঠিন হবে। তা তোমাদের নিকট হঠাৎ এসে পড়বে। তারা তোমাকে প্রশ্ন করছে যেন তুমি এ সম্পর্কে বিশেষভাবে অবহিত। বল, ‘এ বিষয়ের জ্ঞান কেবল আল্লাহর নিকট আছে। কিন্তু অধিকাংশ মানুষ জানে না’।",
        "বল, ‘আমি আমার নিজের কোন উপকার ও ক্ষতির ক্ষমতা রাখি না, তবে আল্লাহ যা চান। আর আমি যদি গায়েব জানতাম তাহলে অধিক কল্যাণ লাভ করতাম এবং আমাকে কোন ক্ষতি স্পর্শ করত না। আমিতো একজন সতর্ককারী ও সুসংবাদদাতা এমন কওমের জন্য, যারা বিশ্বাস করে’।",
        "তিনিই সে সত্তা যিনি তোমাদেরকে সৃষ্টি করেছেন এক ব্যক্তি থেকে এবং তার থেকে বানিয়েছেন তার সঙ্গিনীকে, যাতে সে তার নিকট প্রশান্তি লাভ করে। অতঃপর যখন সে তার সঙ্গিনীর সাথে মিলিত হল, তখন সে হালকা গর্ভ ধারণ করল এবং তা নিয়ে চলাফেরা করতে থাকল। অতঃপর যখন সে ভারী হল, তখন উভয়ে তাদের রব আল্লাহকে ডাকল, ‘যদি আপনি আমাদেরকে সুসন্তান দান করেন তবে অবশ্যই আমরা কৃতজ্ঞদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হব’।",
        "অতঃপর যখন তিনি তাদেরকে এক সুসন্তান দান করলেন, তখন তাদেরকে তিনি যা প্রদান করেছেন সে বিষয়ে তারা তাঁর বহু শরীক নির্ধারণ করল। বস্তুত তারা যাদের শরীক করে তাদের থেকে আল্লাহ অনেক ঊর্ধ্বে।",
        "তারা কি এমন কিছুকে শরীক করে, যারা কোন কিছু সৃষ্টি করে না, বরং তাদেরকেই সৃষ্টি করা হয়?",

        "আল্লাহ ছাড়া যাদেরকে তোমরা ডাক তারা তোমাদের মত বান্দা। সুতরাং তোমরা তাদেরকে ডাক। অতঃপর তারা যেন তোমাদের ডাকে সাড়া দেয়, যদি তোমরা সত্যবাদী হও।",
        "তাদের কি পা আছে যার সাহায্যে তারা চলে? বা তাদের কি হাত আছে যা দ্বারা তারা ধরে? বা তাদের কি চক্ষু আছে যার মাধ্যমে তারা দেখে? অথবা তাদের কি কান আছে যা দ্বারা তারা শুনে? বল, ‘তোমরা তোমাদের শরীকদের ডাক। তারপর আমার বিরুদ্ধে ষড়যন্ত্র কর এবং আমাকে অবকাশ দিয়ো না’।",
        "‘নিশ্চয় আমার অভিভাবক আল্লাহ, যিনি কিতাব নাযিল করেছেন। আর তিনি নেককারদের দেখাশোনা করেন’।",

        "তুমি ক্ষমা প্রদর্শন কর এবং ভালো কাজের আদেশ দাও। আর মূর্খদের থেকে বিমুখ থাক।",
        "আর যদি শয়তানের পক্ষ হতে কোন প্ররোচনা তোমাকে প্ররোচিত করে, তবে তুমি আল্লাহর আশ্রয় চাও। নিশ্চয় তিনি সর্বশ্রোতা, সর্বজ্ঞ।",

        "আর যখন তুমি তাদের নিকট কোন আয়াত নিয়ে না আস, তখন তারা বলে, ‘তুমি কেন নিজেই তা বানিয়ে নাও না?’ বল, ‘আমিতো তারই অনুসরণ করি, যা আমার কাছে আমার রবের পক্ষ থেকে ওহীরূপে প্রেরণ করা হয়। এটি তোমাদের রবের পক্ষ থেকে স্পষ্ট প্রমাণ। আর তা হিদায়াত ও রহমত সে কওমের জন্য যারা ঈমান আনে’।",

        "اور جو لوگ ایمان لائے اور عمل نیک کرتے رہے اور ہم (عملوں کے لیے) کسی شخص کو اس کی طاقت سے زیادہ تکلیف نہیں دیتے۔ ایسے ہی لوگ اہل بہشت ہیں (کہ) اس میں ہمیشہ رہیں گے",
        "اور جو کینے ان کے دلوں میں ہوں گے ہم سب نکال ڈالیں گے۔ ان کے محلوں کے نیچے نہریں بہہ رہی ہوں گی اور کہیں گے کہ خدا کا شکر ہے جس نے ہم کو یہاں کا راستہ دکھایا اور اگر خدا ہم کو رستہ نہ دکھاتا تو ہم رستہ نہ پا سکتے۔ بےشک ہمارا پروردگار کے رسول حق بات لے کر آئے تھے اور (اس روز) منادی کر دی جائے گی کہ تم ان اعمال کے صلے میں جو دنیا میں کرتے تھے اس بہشت کے وارث بنا دیئے گئے ہو",
        "اور اہل بہشت دوزخیوں سے پکار کر کہیں گے کہ جو وعدہ ہمارے پروردگار نے ہم سے کیا تھا ہم نے تو اسے سچا پالیا۔ بھلا جو وعدہ تمہارے پروردگار نے تم سے کیا تھا تم نے بھی اسے سچا پایا؟ وہ کہیں گے ہاں تو (اس وقت) ان میں ایک پکارنے والا پکارے گا کہ بےانصافوں پر خدا کی لعنت",

        "اور جب ان کی نگاہیں پلٹ کر اہل دوزخ کی طرف جائیں گی تو عرض کریں گے کہ اے ہمارے پروردگار ہم کو ظالم لوگوں کے ساتھ شامل نہ کیجیو",
        "اور اہل اعراف (کافر) لوگوں کو جنہیں ان کی صورتوں سے شناخت کرتے ہوں گے پکاریں گے اور کہیں گے (کہ آج) نہ تو تمہاری جماعت ہی تمہارے کچھ کام آئی اور نہ تمہارا تکبّر (ہی سودمند ہوا)",
        "(پھر مومنوں کی طرف اشارہ کر کے کہیں گے) کیا یہ وہی لوگ ہیں جن کے بارے میں تم قسمیں کھایا کرتے تھے کہ خدا اپنی رحمت سے ان کی دستگیری نہیں کرے گا (تو مومنو) تم بہشت میں داخل ہو جاؤ تمہیں کچھ خوف نہیں اور نہ تم کو کچھ رنج واندوہ ہوگا",
        "اور وہ دوزخی بہشتیوں سے (گڑگڑا کر) کہیں گے کہ کسی قدر ہم پر پانی بہاؤ یا جو رزق خدا نے تمہیں عنایت فرمایا ہے ان میں سے (کچھ ہمیں بھی دو) وہ جواب دیں گے کہ خدا نے بہشت کا پانی اور رزق کافروں پر حرام کر دیا ہے",
        "جنہوں نے اپنے دین کو تماشا اور کھیل بنا رکھا تھا اور دنیا کی زندگی نے ان کو دھوکے میں ڈال رکھا تھا۔ تو جس طرح یہ لوگ اس دن کے آنے کو بھولے ہوئے اور ہماری آیتوں سے منکر ہو رہے تھے۔ اسی طرح آج ہم بھی انہیں بھلا دیں گے",
        "اور ہم نے ان کے پاس کتاب پہنچا دی ہے جس کو علم ودانش کے ساتھ کھول کھول کر بیان کر دیا ہے (اور) وہ مومن لوگوں کے لیے ہدایت اور رحمت ہے",
        "کیا یہ لوگ اس کے وعدہٴ عذاب کے منتظر ہیں۔ جس دن وہ وعدہ آجائے گا تو جو لوگ اس کو پہلے سے بھولے ہوئے ہوں گے وہ بول اٹھیں گے کہ بےشک ہمارے پروردگار کے رسول حق لے کر آئے تھے۔ بھلا (آج) ہمارا کوئی سفارشی ہیں کہ ہماری سفارش کریں یا ہم (دنیا میں) پھر لوٹا دیئے جائیں کہ جو عمل (بد) ہم (پہلے) کرتے تھے (وہ نہ کریں بلکہ) ان کے سوا اور (نیک) عمل کریں۔ بےشک ان لوگوں نے اپنا نقصان کیا اور جو کچھ یہ افتراء کیا کرتے تھے ان سے سب جاتا رہا",
        "کچھ شک نہیں کہ تمہارا پروردگار خدا ہی ہے جس نے آسمانوں اور زمین کو چھ دن میں پیدا کیا پھر عرش پر جا ٹھہرا۔ وہی رات کو دن کا لباس پہناتا ہے کہ وہ اس کے پیچھے دوڑتا چلا آتا ہے۔ اور اسی نے سورج اور چاند ستاروں کو پیدا کیا سب اس کے حکم کے مطابق کام میں لگے ہوئے ہیں۔ دیکھو سب مخلوق بھی اسی کی ہے اور حکم بھی (اسی کا ہے)۔ یہ خدا رب العالمین بڑی برکت والا ہے",
        "(لوگو) اپنے پروردگار سے عاجزی سے اور چپکے چپکے دعائیں مانگا کرو۔ وہ حد سے بڑھنے والوں کو دوست نہیں رکھتا",
        "اور ملک میں اصلاح کے بعد خرابی نہ کرنا اور خدا سے خوف کرتے ہوئے اور امید رکھ کر دعائیں مانگتے رہنا۔ کچھ شک نہیں کہ خدا کی رحمت نیکی کرنے والوں سے قریب ہے",
        "اور وہی تو ہے جو اپنی رحمت (یعنی مینھ) سے پہلے ہواؤں کو خوشخبری (بنا کر) بھیجتا ہے۔ یہاں تک کہ جب وہ بھاری بھاری بادلوں کو اٹھا لاتی ہے تو ہم اس کو ایک مری ہوئی بستی کی طرف ہانک دیتے ہیں۔ پھر بادل سے مینھ برساتے ہیں۔ پھر مینھ سے ہر طرح کے پھل پیدا کرتے ہیں۔ اسی طرح ہم مردوں کو (زمین سے) زندہ کرکے باہر نکال لیں گے۔ (یہ آیات اس لیے بیان کی جاتی ہیں) تاکہ تم نصیحت پکڑو",
        "جو زمین پاکیزہ (ہے) اس میں سے سبزہ بھی پروردگار کے حکم سے (نفیس ہی) نکلتا ہے اور جو خراب ہے اس میں جو کچھ ہے ناقص ہوتا ہے۔ اسی طرح ہم آیتوں کو شکرگزار لوگوں کے لئے پھیر پھیر کر بیان کرتے ہیں",
        "ہم نے نوح کو ان کی قوم کی طرف بھیجا تو انہوں نے (ان سے کہا) اے میری برادری کے لوگو خدا کی عبادت کرو اس کے سوا تمہارا کوئی معبود نہیں۔ مجھے تمہارے بارے میں بڑے دن کے عذاب کا (بہت ہی) ڈر ہے",
        "تو جو ان کی قوم میں سردار تھے وہ کہنے لگے کہ ہم تمہیں صریح گمراہی میں (مبتلا) دیکھتے ہیں",
        "انہوں نے کہا اے قوم مجھ میں کسی طرح کی گمراہی نہیں ہے بلکہ میں پروردگار عالم کا پیغمبر ہوں",
        "تمہیں اپنے پروردگار کے پیغام پہنچاتا ہوں اور تمہاری خیرخواہی کرتا ہوں اور مجھ کو خدا کی طرف سے ایسی باتیں معلوم ہیں جن سے تم بےخبر ہو",
        "کیا تم کو اس بات سے تعجب ہوا ہے کہ تم میں سے ایک شخص کے ہاتھ تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے تمہارے پاس نصیحت آئی تاکہ وہ تم کو ڈرائے اور تاکہ تم پرہیزگار بنو اور تاکہ تم پر رحم کیا جائے",
        "مگر ان لوگوں نے ان کی تکذیب کی۔ تو ہم نے نوح کو اور جو ان کے ساتھ کشتی میں سوار تھے ان کو تو بچا لیا اور جن لوگوں نے ہماری آیتوں کو جھٹلایا تھا انہیں غرق کر دیا۔ کچھ شک نہیں کہ وہ اندھے لوگ تھے",
        "اور (اسی طرح) قوم عاد کی طرف ان کے بھائی ہود کو بھیجا۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ بھائیو خدا ہی کی عبادت کرو۔ اس کے سوا تمہارا کوئی معبود نہیں۔ کیا تم ڈرتے نہیں؟",
        "تو ان کی قوم کے سردار جو کافر تھے کہنے لگے کہ تم ہمیں احمق نظر آتے ہو اور ہم تمہیں جھوٹا خیال کرتے ہیں",
        "انہوں نے کہا کہ بھائیو مجھ میں حماقت کی کوئی بات نہیں ہے بلکہ میں رب العالمین کا پیغمبر ہوں",
        "میں تمہیں خدا کے پیغام پہنچاتا ہوں اور تمہارا امانت دار خیرخواہ ہوں",
        "کیا تم کو اس بات سے تعجب ہوا ہے کہ تم میں سے ایک شخص کے ہاتھ تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے تمہارے پاس نصیحت آئی تاکہ وہ تمہیں ڈرائے اور یاد کرو تو کرو جب اس نے تم کو قوم نوح کے بعد سردار بنایا۔ اور تم کو پھیلاؤ زیادہ دیا۔ پس خدا کی نعمتوں کو یاد کرو۔ تاکہ نجات حاصل کرو",
        "وہ کہنے لگے کہ تم ہمارے پاس اس لیے آئے ہو کہ ہم اکیلے خدا ہی کی عبادت کریں۔ اور جن کو ہمارے باپ دادا پوجتے چلے آئے ہیں ان کو چھوڑ دیں؟ تو اگر سچے ہو تو جس چیز سے ہمیں ڈراتے ہو اسے لے آؤ",
        "ہود نے کہا تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے تم پر عذاب اور غضب کا (نازل ہونا) مقرر ہو چکا ہے۔ کیا تم مجھ سے ایسے ناموں کے بارے میں جھگڑتے ہو جو تم نے اور تمہارے باپ دادا نے (اپنی طرف سے) رکھ لئے ہیں۔ جن کی خدا نے کوئی سند نازل نہیں کی۔ تو تم بھی انتظار کرو میں بھی تمہارے ساتھ انتظار کرتا ہوں",
        "پھر ہم نے ہود کو اور جو لوگ ان کے ساتھ تھے ان کو نجات بخشی اور جنہوں نے ہماری آیتوں کو جھٹلایا تھا ان کی جڑ کاٹ دی اور وہ ایمان لانے والے تھے ہی نہیں",
        "اور قوم ثمود کی طرف ان کے بھائی صالح کو بھیجا۔ (تو) صالح نے کہا کہ اے قوم! خدا ہی کی عبادت کرو اس کے سوا تمہارا کوئی معبود نہیں۔ تمہارے پاس تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے ایک معجزہ آ چکا ہے۔ (یعنی) یہی خدا کی اونٹنی تمہارے لیے معجزہ ہے۔ تو اسے (آزاد) چھوڑ دو کہ خدا کی زمین میں چرتی پھرے اور تم اسے بری نیت سے ہاتھ بھی نہ لگانا۔ ورنہ عذابِ الیم میں تمہیں پکڑ لے گا",
        "اور یاد تو کرو جب اس نے تم کو قوم عاد کے بعد سردار بنایا اور زمین پر آباد کیا کہ نرم زمین سے (مٹی لے لے کر) محل تعمیر کرتے ہو اور پہاڑوں کو تراش تراش کر گھر بناتے ہو۔ پس خدا کی نعمتوں کو یاد کرو اور زمین میں فساد نہ کرتے پھرو",
        "تو ان کی قوم میں سردار لوگ جو غرور رکھتے تھے غریب لوگوں سے جو ان میں سے ایمان لے آئے تھے کہنے لگے بھلا تم یقین کرتے ہو کہ صالح اپنے پروردگار کی طرف بھیجے گئے ہیں؟ انہوں نے کہا ہاں جو چیز دے کر وہ بھیجے گئے ہیں ہم اس پر بلاشبہ ایمان رکھتے ہیں",
        "تو (سرداران) مغرور کہنے لگے کہ جس چیز پر تم ایمان لائے ہو ہم تو اس کو نہیں مانتے",
        "آخر انہوں نے اونٹی (کی کونچوں) کو کاٹ ڈالا اور اپنے پروردگار کے حکم سے سرکشی کی اور کہنے لگے کہ صالح! جس چیز سے تم ہمیں ڈراتے تھے اگر تم (خدا کے) پیغمبر ہو تو اسے ہم پر لے آؤ",
        "تو ان کو بھونچال نے آ پکڑا اور وہ اپنے گھروں میں اوندھے پڑے رہ گئے",
        "پھر صالح ان سے (ناامید ہو کر) پھرے اور کہا کہ میری قوم! میں نے تم کو خدا کا پیغام پہنچا دیا اور تمہاری خیر خواہی کی مگر تم (ایسے ہو کہ) خیر خواہوں کو دوست ہی نہیں رکھتے",
        "اور اسی طرح جب ہم نے لوط کو (پیغمبر بنا کر بھیجا تو) اس وقت انہوں نے اپنی قوم سے کہا کہ تم ایسی بےحیائی کا کام کیوں کرتے ہو کہ تم سے اہل عالم میں سے کسی نے اس طرح کا کام نہیں کیا",
        "یعنی خواہش نفسانی پورا کرنے کے لیے عورتوں کو چھوڑ کر لونڈوں پر گرتے ہو۔ حقیقت یہ ہے کہ تم لوگ حد سے نکل جانے والے ہو",
        "تو ان سے اس کا جواب کچھ نہ بن پڑا اور بولے تو یہ بولے کہ ان لوگوں (یعنی لوط اور اس کے گھر والوں) کو اپنے گاؤں سے نکال دو (کہ) یہ لوگ پاک بننا چاہتے ہیں",
        "تو ہم نے ان کو اور ان کے گھر والوں کو بچا لیا مگر ان کی بی بی (نہ بچی) کہ وہ پیچھے رہنے والوں میں تھی",
        "اور ہم نے ان پر (پتھروں کا) مینھ برسایا۔ سو دیکھ لو کہ گنہگاروں کا کیسا انجام ہوا",
        "اور مَدین کی طرف ان کے بھائی شعیب کو بھیجا۔ (تو) انہوں نے کہا کہ قوم! خدا ہی کی عبادت کرو اس کے سوا تمہارا کوئی معبود نہیں۔ تمہارے پاس تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے نشانی آچکی ہے تو تم ناپ تول پوری کیا کرو اور لوگوں کو چیزیں کم نہ دیا کرو۔ اور زمین میں اصلاح کے بعد خرابی نہ کرو۔ اگر تم صاحب ایمان ہو تو سمجھ لو کہ یہ بات تمہارے حق میں بہتر ہے",
        "اور ہر رستے پر مت بیٹھا کرو کہ جو شخص خدا پر ایمان نہیں لاتا ہے اسے تم ڈراتے اور راہ خدا سے روکتے اور اس میں کجی ڈھونڈتے ہو اور (اس وقت کو) یاد کرو جب تم تھوڑے سے تھے تو خدا نے تم کو جماعت کثیر کر دیا اور دیکھ لو کہ خرابی کرنے والوں کا انجام کیسا ہوا",
        "اور اگر تم میں سے ایک جماعت میری رسالت پر ایمان لے آئی ہے اور ایک جماعت ایمان نہیں لائی ہے۔ اور ایک جماعت ایمان نہیں لائی۔ تو صبر کیے رہو یہاں تک کہ خدا ہمارے تمہارے درمیان فیصلہ کر دے اور وہ سب سے بہتر فیصلہ کرنے والا ہے",
        "(تو) ان کی قوم میں جو لوگ سردار اور بڑے آدمی تھے، وہ کہنے لگے کہ شعیب! (یا تو) ہم تم کو اور جو لوگ تمہارے ساتھ ایمان لائے ہیں، ان کو اپنے شہر سے نکال دیں گے۔ یا تم ہمارے مذہب میں آجاؤ۔ انہوں نے کہا خواہ ہم (تمہارے دین سے) بیزار ہی ہوں (تو بھی؟)",
        "اگر ہم اس کے بعد کہ خدا ہمیں اس سے نجات بخش چکا ہے تمہارے مذہب میں لوٹ جائیں تو بےشک ہم نے خدا پر جھوٹ افتراء باندھا۔ اور ہمیں شایاں نہیں کہ ہم اس میں لوٹ جائیں ہاں خدا جو ہمارا پروردگار ہے وہ چاہے تو (ہم مجبور ہیں)۔ ہمارے پروردگار کا علم ہر چیز پر احاطہ کیے ہوئے ہے۔ ہمارا خدا ہی پر بھروسہ ہے۔ اے پروردگار ہم میں اور ہماری قوم میں انصاف کے ساتھ فیصلہ کردے اور تو سب سے بہتر فیصلہ کرنے والا ہے",
        "اور ان کی قوم میں سے سردار لوگ جو کافر تھے، کہنے لگے (بھائیو) اگر تم نے شعیب کی پیروی کی تو بےشک تم خسارے میں پڑگئے",
        "تو ان کو بھونچال نے آپکڑا اور وہ اپنے گھروں میں اوندھے پڑے رہ گئے",
        "(یہ لوگ) جنہوں نے شعیب کی تکذیب کی تھی ایسے برباد ہوئے تھے کہ گویا وہ ان میں کبھی آباد ہی نہیں ہوئے تھے (غرض) جنہوں نے شعیب کو جھٹلایا وہ خسارے میں پڑگئے",
        "تو شعیب ان میں سے نکل آئے اور کہا کہ بھائیو میں نے تم کو اپنے پروردگار کے پیغام پہنچا دیئے ہیں اور تمہاری خیرخواہی کی تھی۔ تو میں کافروں پر (عذاب نازل ہونے سے) رنج وغم کیوں کروں",
        "اور ہم نے کسی شہر میں کوئی پیغمبر نہیں بھیجا مگر وہاں کے رہنے والوں کو (جو ایمان نہ لائے) دکھوں اور مصیبتوں میں مبتلا کیا تاکہ وہ عاجزی اور زاری کریں",
        "پھر ہم نے تکلیف کو آسودگی سے بدل دیا یہاں تک کہ (مال واولاد میں) زیادہ ہوگئے تو کہنے لگے کہ اس طرح کا رنج وراحت ہمارے بڑوں کو بھی پہنچتا رہا ہے تو ہم نے ان کو ناگہاں پکڑلیا اور وہ (اپنے حال میں) بےخبر تھے",
        "اگر ان بستیوں کے لوگ ایمان لے آتے اور پرہیزگار ہوجاتے۔ تو ہم ان پر آسمان اور زمین کی برکات (کے دروازے) کھول دیتے مگر انہوں نے تو تکذیب کی۔ سو ان کے اعمال کی سزا میں ہم نے ان کو پکڑ لیا",
        "کیا بستیوں کے رہنے والے اس سے بےخوف ہیں کہ ان پر ہمارا عذاب رات کو واقع ہو اور وہ (بےخبر) سو رہے ہوں",
        "اور کیا اہلِ شہر اس سے نڈر ہیں کہ ان پر ہمارا عذاب دن چڑھے آ نازل ہو اور وہ کھیل رہے ہوں",
        "کیا یہ لوگ خدا کے داؤ کا ڈر نہیں رکھتے (سن لو کہ) خدا کے داؤ سے وہی لوگ نڈر ہوتے ہیں جو خسارہ پانے والے ہیں",
        "کیا ان لوگوں کو جو اہلِ زمین کے (مرجانے کے) بعد زمین کے مالک ہوتے ہیں، یہ امر موجب ہدایت نہیں ہوا کہ اگر ہم چاہیں تو ان کے گناہوں کے سبب ان پر مصیبت ڈال دیں۔ اور ان کے دلوں پر مہر لگادیں کہ کچھ سن ہی نہ سکیں",
        "یہ بستیاں ہیں جن کے کچھ حالات ہم تم کو سناتے ہیں۔ اور ان کے پاس ان کے پیغمبر نشانیاں لے کر آئے۔ مگر وہ ایسے نہیں تھے کہ جس چیز کو پہلے جھٹلا چکے ہوں اسے مان لیں اسی طرح خدا کافروں کے دلوں پر مہر لگا دیتا ہے",
        "اور ہم نے ان میں سے اکثروں میں (عہد کا نباہ) نہیں دیکھا۔ اور ان میں اکثروں کو (دیکھا تو) بدکار ہی دیکھا",
        "پھر ان (پیغمبروں) کے بعد ہم نے موسیٰ کو نشانیاں دے کر فرعون اور اس کے اعیانِ سلطنت کے پاس بھیجا تو انہوں نے ان کے ساتھ کفر کیا۔ سو دیکھ لو کہ خرابی کرنے والوں کا انجام کیا ہوا",
        "اور موسیٰ نے کہا کہ اے فرعون میں رب العالمین کا پیغمبر ہوں",
        "مجھ پر واجب ہے کہ خدا کی طرف سے جو کچھ کہوں سچ ہی کہوں۔ میں تمہارے پاس تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے نشانی لے کر آیا ہوں۔ سو بنی اسرائیل کو میرے ساتھ جانے کی رخصت دے دیجیے",
        "فرعون نے کہا اگر تم نشانی لے کر آئے ہو تو اگر سچے ہو تو لاؤ (دکھاؤ)",
        "موسیٰ نے اپنی لاٹھی (زمین پر) ڈال دی تو وہ اسی وقت صریح اژدھا (ہوگیا)",
        "اور اپنا ہاتھ باہر نکالا تو اسی دم دیکھنے والوں کی نگاہوں میں سفید براق (تھا)",
        "تو قوم فرعون میں جو سردار تھے وہ کہنے لگے کہ یہ بڑا علامہ جادوگر ہے",
        "اس کا ارادہ یہ ہے کہ تم کو تمہارے ملک سے نکال دے۔ بھلا تمہاری کیا صلاح ہے؟",
        "انہوں نے (فرعون سے) کہا کہ فی الحال موسیٰ اور اس کے بھائی کے معاملے کو معاف رکھیے اور شہروں میں نقیب روانہ کر دیجیے",
        "کہ تمام ماہر جادوگروں کو آپ کے پاس لے آئیں",
        "(چنانچہ ایسا ہی کیا گیا) اور جادوگر فرعون کے پاس آپہنچے اور کہنے لگے کہ اگر ہم جیت گئے تو ہمیں صلہ عطا کیا جائے",
        "(فرعون نے) کہا ہاں (ضرور) اور (اس کے علاوہ) تم مقربوں میں داخل کرلیے جاؤ گے",
        "(جب فریقین روزِ مقررہ پر جمع ہوئے تو) جادوگروں نے کہا کہ موسیٰ یا تو تم (جادو کی چیز) ڈالو یا ہم ڈالتے ہیں",
        "(موسیٰ نے) کہا تم ہی ڈالو۔ جب انہوں نے (جادو کی چیزیں) ڈالیں تو لوگوں کی آنکھوں پر جادو کردیا (یعنی نظربندی کردی) اور (لاٹھیوں اور رسیوں کے سانپ بنا بنا کر) انہیں ڈرا دیا اور بہت بڑا جادو دکھایا",
        "(اس وقت) ہم نے موسیٰ کی طرف وحی بھیجی کہ تم بھی اپنی لاٹھی ڈال دو۔ وہ فوراً (سانپ بن کر) جادوگروں کے بنائے ہوئے سانپوں کو (ایک ایک کرکے) نگل جائے گی",
        "(پھر) تو حق ثابت ہوگیا اور جو کچھ فرعونی کرتے تھے، باطل ہوگیا",
        "اور وہ مغلوب ہوگئے اور ذلیل ہوکر رہ گئے",
        "(یہ کیفیت دیکھ کر) جادوگر سجدے میں گر پڑے",
        "اور کہنے لگے کہ ہم جہان کے پروردگار پر ایمان لائے",
        "یعنی موسیٰ اور ہارون کے پروردگار پر",
        "فرعون نے کہا کہ پیشتر اس کے کہ میں تمہیں اجازت دوں تم اس پر ایمان لے آئے؟ بےشک یہ فریب ہے جو تم نے مل کر شہر میں کیا ہے تاکہ اہلِ شہر کو یہاں سے نکال دو۔ سو عنقریب (اس کا نتیجہ) معلوم کرلو گے",
        "میں (پہلے تو) تمہارے ایک طرف کے ہاتھ اور دوسری طرف کے پاؤں کٹوا دوں گا پھر تم سب کو سولی چڑھوا دوں گا",
        "وہ بولے کہ ہم تو اپنے پروردگار کی طرف لوٹ کر جانے والے ہیں",
        "اور اس کے سوا تجھ کو ہماری کون سی بات بری لگی ہے کہ جب ہمارے پروردگار کی نشانیاں ہمارے پاس آگئیں تو ہم ان پر ایمان لے آئے۔ اے پروردگار ہم پر صبرواستقامت کے دہانے کھول دے اور ہمیں (ماریو تو) مسلمان ہی ماریو",
        "اور قومِ فرعون میں جو سردار تھے کہنے لگے کہ کیا آپ موسیٰ اور اس کی قوم کو چھوڑ دیجیے گا کہ ملک میں خرابی کریں اور آپ سے اور آپ کے معبودوں سے دست کش ہوجائیں۔ وہ بولے کہ ہم ان کے لڑکوں کو قتل کرڈالیں گے اور لڑکیوں کو زندہ رہنے دیں گے اور بےشک ہم ان پر غالب ہیں",
        "موسیٰ نے اپنی قوم سے کہا کہ خدا سے مدد مانگو اور ثابت قدم رہو۔ زمین تو خدا کی ہے۔ وہ اپنے بندوں میں سے جسے چاہتا ہے اس کا مالک بناتا ہے۔ اور آخر بھلا تو ڈرنے والوں کا ہے",
        "وہ بولے کہ تمہارے آنے سے پہلے بھی ہم کو اذیتیں پہنچتی رہیں اور آنے کے بعد بھی۔ موسیٰ نے کہا کہ قریب ہے کہ تمہارا پروردگار تمہارے دشمن کو ہلاک کردے اور اس کی جگہ تمہیں زمین میں خلیفہ بنائے پھر دیکھے کہ تم کیسے عمل کرتے ہو",
        "اور ہم نے فرعونیوں کو قحطوں اور میووں کے نقصان میں پکڑا تاکہ نصیحت حاصل کریں",
        "تو جب ان کو آسائش حاصل ہوتی تو کہتے کہ ہم اس کے مستحق ہیں۔ اور اگر سختی پہنچتی تو موسیٰ اور ان کے رفیقوں کی بدشگونی بتاتے۔ دیکھو ان کی بدشگونی خدا کے ہاں مقرر ہے لیکن ان میں اکثر نہیں جانتے",
        "اور کہنے لگے کہ تم ہمارے پاس (خواہ) کوئی ہی نشانی لاؤ تاکہ اس سے ہم پر جادو کرو۔ مگر ہم تم پر ایمان لانے والے نہیں ہیں",
        "تو ہم نے ان پر طوفان اور ٹڈیاں اور جوئیں اور مینڈک اور خون کتنی کھلی ہوئی نشانیاں بھیجیں۔ مگر وہ تکبر ہی کرتے رہے اور وہ لوگ تھے ہی گنہگار",
        "اور جب ان پر عذاب واقع ہوتا تو کہتے کہ موسیٰ ہمارے لیے اپنے پروردگار سے دعا کرو۔ جیسا اس نے تم سے عہد کر رکھا ہے۔ اگر تم ہم سے عذاب کو ٹال دو گے تو ہم تم پر ایمان بھی لے آئیں گے اور بنی اسرائیل کو بھی تمہارے ساتھ جانے (کی اجازت) دیں گے",
        "پھر جب ہم ایک مدت کے لیے جس تک ان کو پہنچنا تھا ان سے عذاب دور کردیتے تو وہ عہد کو توڑ ڈالتے",
        "تو ہم نے ان سے بدلہ لے کر ہی چھوڑا کہ ان کو دریا میں ڈبو دیا اس لیے کہ وہ ہماری آیتوں کو جھٹلاتے اور ان سے بےپروائی کرتے تھے",
        "اور جو لوگ کمزور سمجھے جاتے تھے ان کو زمین (شام) کے مشرق ومغرب کا جس میں ہم نے برکت دی تھی وارث کردیا اور بنی اسرائیل کے بارے میں ان کے صبر کی وجہ سے تمہارے پروردگار کا وعدہٴ نیک پورا ہوا اور فرعون اور قوم فرعون جو (محل) بناتے اور (انگور کے باغ) جو چھتریوں پر چڑھاتے تھے سب کو ہم نے تباہ کردیا",
        "اور ہم نے بنی اسرائیل کو دریا کے پار اتارا تو وہ ایسے لوگوں کے پاس جا پہنچے جو اپنے بتوں (کی عبادت) کے لیے بیٹھے رہتے تھے۔ (بنی اسرائیل) کہنے لگے کہ موسیٰ جیسے ان لوگوں کے معبود ہیں۔ ہمارے لیے بھی ایک معبود بنا دو۔ موسیٰ نے کہا کہ تم بڑے ہی جاہل لوگ ہو",
        "یہ لوگ جس (شغل) میں (پھنسے ہوئے) ہیں وہ برباد ہونے والا ہے اور جو کام یہ کرتے ہیں سب بیہودہ ہیں",
        "(اور یہ بھی) کہا کہ بھلا میں خدا کے سوا تمہارے لیے کوئی اور معبود تلاش کروں حالانکہ اس نے تم کو تمام اہل عالم پر فضیلت بخشی ہے",
        "(اور ہمارے ان احسانوں کو یاد کرو) جب ہم نے تم کو فرعونیوں (کے ہاتھ) سے نجات بخشی وہ لوگ تم کو بڑا دکھ دیتے تھے۔ تمہارے بیٹوں کو قتل کر ڈالتے تھے اور بیٹیوں کو زندہ رہنے دیتے تھے۔ اور اس میں تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے سخت آزمائش تھی",
        "اور ہم نے موسیٰ سے تیس رات کی میعاد مقرر کی۔ اور اس دس (راتیں) اور ملا کر اسے پورا (چلّہ) کردیا تو اس کے پروردگار کی چالیس رات کی میعاد پوری ہوگئی۔ اور موسیٰ نے اپنے بھائی ہارون سے کہا کہ میرے (کوہِٰ طور پر جانے کے) بعد تم میری قوم میں میرے جانشین ہو (ان کی) اصلاح کرتے رہنا ٹھیک اور شریروں کے رستے نہ چلنا",
        "اور جب موسیٰ ہمارے مقرر کیے ہوئے وقت پر (کوہ طور) پر پہنچے اور ان کے پروردگار نے ان سے کلام کیا تو کہنے لگے کہ اے پروردگار مجھے (جلوہ) دکھا کہ میں تیرا دیدار (بھی) دیکھوں۔ پروردگار نے کہا کہ تم مجھے ہرگز نہ دیکھ سکو گے۔ ہاں پہاڑ کی طرف دیکھتے رہو اگر یہ اپنی جگہ قائم رہا تو تم مجھے دیکھ سکو گے۔ جب ان کا پروردگار پہاڑ پر نمودار ہوا تو (تجلی انوارِ ربانی) نے اس کو ریزہ ریزہ کردیا اور موسیٰ بےہوش ہو کر گر پڑے۔ جب ہوش میں آئے تو کہنے لگے کہ تیری ذات پاک ہے اور میں تیرے حضور توبہ کرتا ہوں اور جو ایمان لانے والے ہیں ان میں سب سے اول ہوں",
        "(خدا نے) فرمایا موسیٰ میں نے تم کو اپنے پیغام اور اپنے کلام سے لوگوں سے ممتاز کیا ہے۔ تو جو میں نے تم کو عطا کیا ہے اسے پکڑ رکھو اور (میرا) شکر بجالاؤ",
        "اور ہم نے (تورات) کی تختیوں میں ان کے لیے ہر قسم کی نصیحت اور ہر چیز کی تفصیل لکھ دی پھر (ارشاد فرمایا کہ) اسے زور سے پکڑے رہو اور اپنی قوم سے بھی کہہ دو کہ ان باتوں کو جو اس میں (مندرج ہیں اور) بہت بہتر ہیں پکڑے رہیں۔ میں عنقریب تم کو نافرمان لوگوں کا گھر دکھاؤں گا",
        "جو لوگ زمین میں ناحق غرور کرتے ہیں ان کو اپنی آیتوں سے پھیر دوں گا۔ اگر یہ سب نشانیاں بھی دیکھ لیں تب بھی ان پر ایمان نہ لائیں اور اگر راستی کا رستہ دیکھیں تو اسے (اپنا) رستہ نہ بنائیں۔ اور اگر گمراہی کی راہ دیکھیں تو اسے رستہ بنالیں۔ یہ اس لیے کہ انہوں نے ہماری آیات کو جھٹلایا اور ان سے غفلت کرتے رہے",
        "اور جن لوگوں نے ہماری آیتوں اور آخرت کے آنے کو جھٹلایا ان کے اعمال ضائع ہوجائیں گے۔ یہ جیسے عمل کرتے ہیں ویسا ہی ان کو بدلہ ملے گا",
        "اور قوم موسیٰ نے موسیٰ کے بعد اپنے زیور کا ایک بچھڑا بنا لیا (وہ) ایک جسم (تھا) جس میں سے بیل کی آواز نکلتی تھی۔ ان لوگوں نے یہ نہ دیکھا کہ وہ نہ ان سے بات کرسکتا ہے اور نہ ان کو راستہ دکھا سکتا ہے۔ اس کو انہوں نے (معبود) بنالیا اور (اپنے حق میں) ظلم کیا",
        "اور جب وہ نادم ہوئے اور دیکھا کہ گمراہ ہوگئے ہیں تو کہنے لگے کہ اگر ہمارا پروردگار ہم پر رحم نہیں کرے گا اور ہم کو معاف نہیں فرمائے گا تو ہم برباد ہوجائیں گے",
        "اور جب موسیٰ اپنی قوم میں نہایت غصے اور افسوس کی حالت میں واپس آئے۔ تو کہنے لگے کہ تم نے میرے بعد بہت ہی بداطواری کی۔ کیا تم نے اپنے پروردگار کا حکم (یعنی میرا اپنے پاس آنا) جلد چاہا (یہ کہا) اور (شدت غضب سے تورات کی) تختیاں ڈال دیں اور اپنے بھائی کے سر (کے بالوں) کو پکڑ کر اپنی طرف کھینچنے لگے۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ بھائی جان لوگ تو مجھے کمزور سمجھتے تھے اور قریب تھا کہ قتل کردیں۔ تو ایسا کام نہ کیجیے کہ دشمن مجھ پر ہنسیں اور مجھے ظالم لوگوں میں مت ملایئے",
        "تب انہوں نے دعا کی کہ اے میرے پروردگار مجھے اور میرے بھائی کو معاف فرما اور ہمیں اپنی رحمت میں داخل کر تو سب سے بڑھ کر رحم کرنے والا ہے",
        "(خدا نے فرمایا کہ) جن لوگوں نے بچھڑے کو (معبود) بنا لیا تھا ان پر پروردگار کا غضب واقع ہوگا اور دنیا کی زندگی میں ذلت (نصیب ہوگی) اور ہم افتراء پردازوں کو ایسا ہی بدلہ دیا کرتے ہیں",
        "اور جنہوں نے برے کام کیے پھر اس کے بعد توبہ کرلی اور ایمان لے آئے تو کچھ شک نہیں کہ تمہارا پروردگار اس کے بعد (بخش دے گا کہ وہ) بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "اور جب موسیٰ کا غصہ فرو ہوا تو (تورات) کی تختیاں اٹھالیں اور جو کچھ ان میں لکھا تھا وہ ان لوگوں کے لیے جو اپنے پروردگار سے ڈرتے ہیں۔ ہدایت اور رحمت تھی",
        "اور موسیٰ نے اس میعاد پر جو ہم نے مقرر کی تھی اپنی قوم کے ستر آدمی منتخب (کرکے کوہ طور پر حاضر) ٹل کیے۔ جب ان کو زلزلے نے پکڑا تو موسیٰ نے کہا کہ اے پروردگار تو چاہتا تو ان کو اور مجھ کو پہلے ہی سے ہلاک کر دیتا۔ کیا تو اس فعل کی سزا میں جو ہم میں سے بےعقل لوگوں نے کیا ہے ہمیں ہلاک کردے گا۔ یہ تو تیری آزمائش ہے۔ اس سے تو جس کو چاہے گمراہ کرے اور جس کو چاہے ہدایت بخشے۔ تو ہی ہمارا کارساز ہے تو ہمیں (ہمارے گناہ) بخش دے اور ہم پر رحم فرما اور تو سب سے بہتر بخشنے والا ہے",
        "اور ہمارے لیے اس دنیا میں بھی بھلائی لکھ دے اور آخرت میں بھی۔ ہم تیری طرف رجوع ہوچکے۔ فرمایا کہ جو میرا عذاب ہے اسے تو جس پر چاہتا ہوں نازل کرتا ہوں اور جو میری رحمت ہے وہ ہر چیز کو شامل ہے۔ میں اس کو ان لوگوں کے لیے لکھ دوں گا جو پرہیزگاری کرتے اور زکوٰة دیتے اور ہماری آیتوں پر ایمان رکھتے ہیں",
        "وہ جو (محمدﷺ) رسول (الله) کی جو نبی اُمی ہیں پیروی کرتے ہیں جن (کے اوصاف) کو وہ اپنے ہاں تورات اور انجیل میں لکھا ہوا پاتے ہیں۔ وہ انہیں نیک کام کا حکم دیتے ہیں اور برے کام سے روکتے ہیں۔ اور پاک چیزوں کو ان کے لیے حلال کرتے ہیں اور ناپاک چیزوں کو ان پر حرام ٹہراتے ہیں اور ان پر سے بوجھ اور طوق جو ان (کے سر) پر (اور گلے میں) تھے اتارتے ہیں۔ تو جو لوگ ان پر ایمان لائے اور ان کی رفاقت کی اور انہیں مدد دی۔ اور جو نور ان کے ساتھ نازل ہوا ہے اس کی پیروی کی۔ وہی مراد پانے والے ہیں",
        "(اے محمدﷺ) کہہ دو کہ لوگو میں تم سب کی طرف خدا کا بھیجا ہوا (یعنی اس کا رسول) ہوں۔ (وہ) جو آسمانوں اور زمین کا بادشاہ ہے۔ اس کے سوا کوئی معبود نہیں وہی زندگانی بخشتا ہے اور وہی موت دیتا ہے۔ تو خدا پر اور اس کے رسول پیغمبر اُمی پر جو خدا پر اور اس کے تمام کلام پر ایمان رکھتے ہیں ایمان لاؤ اور ان کی پیروی کرو تاکہ ہدایت پاؤ",
        "اور قوم موسیٰ میں کچھ لوگ ایسے بھی ہیں جو حق کا راستہ بتاتے اور اسی کے ساتھ انصاف کرتے ہیں",
        "اور ہم نے ان کو (یعنی بنی اسرائیل کو) الگ الگ کرکے بارہ قبیلے (اور) بڑی بڑی جماعتیں بنا دیا۔ اور جب موسیٰ سے ان کی قوم نے پانی طلب کیا تو ہم نے ان کی طرف وحی بھیجی کہ اپنی لاٹھی پتھر پر مار دو۔ تو اس میں سے بارہ چشمے پھوٹ نکلے۔ اور سب لوگوں نے اپنا اپنا گھاٹ معلوم کرلیا۔ اور ہم نے ان (کے سروں) پر بادل کو سائبان بنائے رکھا اور ان پر من وسلویٰ اتارتے رہے۔ اور (ان سے کہا کہ) جو پاکیزہ چیزیں ہم تمہیں دیتے ہیں انہیں کھاؤ۔ اور ان لوگوں نے ہمارا کچھ نقصان نہیں کیا بلکہ (جو) نقصان کیا اپنا ہی کیا",
        "اور (یاد کرو) جب ان سے کہا گیا کہ اس شہر میں سکونت اختیار کرلو اور اس میں جہاں سے جی چاہے کھانا (پینا) اور (ہاں شہر میں جانا تو) حِطّتہٌ کہنا اور دروازے میں داخل ہونا تو سجدہ کرنا۔ ہم تمہارے گناہ معاف کردیں گے۔ اور نیکی کرنے والوں کو اور زیادہ دیں گے",
        "مگر جو ان میں ظالم تھے انہوں نے اس لفظ کو جس کا ان کو حکم دیا گیا تھا بدل کر اس کی جگہ اور لفظ کہنا شروع کیا تو ہم نے ان پر آسمان سے عذاب بھیجا اس لیے کہ ظلم کرتے تھے",
        "اور ان سے اس گاؤں کا حال تو پوچھو جب لب دریا واقع تھا۔ جب یہ لوگ ہفتے کے دن کے بارے میں حد سے تجاوز کرنے لگے (یعنی) اس وقت کہ ان کے ہفتے کے دن مچھلیاں ان کے سامنے پانی کے اوپر آتیں اور جب ہفتے کا دن نہ ہوتا تو نہ آتیں۔ اسی طرح ہم ان لوگوں کو ان کی نافرمانیوں کے سبب آزمائش میں ڈالنے لگے",
        "اور جب ان میں سے ایک جماعت نے کہا کہ تم ایسے لوگوں کو کیوں نصیحت کرتے ہو جن کو الله ہلاک کرنے والا یا سخت عذاب دینے والا ہے تو انہوں نے کہا اس لیے کہ تمہارے پروردگار کے سامنے معذرت کرسکیں اور عجب نہیں کہ وہ پرہیزگاری اختیار کریں",
        "جب انہوں نے ان باتوں کو فراموش کردیا جن کی ان کو نصیحت کی گئی تھی تو جو لوگ برائی سے منع کرتے تھے ان کو ہم نے نجات دی اور جو ظلم کرتے تھے ان کو برے عذاب میں پکڑ لیا کہ نافرمانی کئے جاتے تھے",
        "غرض جن اعمال (بد) سے ان کو منع کیا گیا تھا جب وہ ان (پراصرار اور ہمارے حکم سے) گردن کشی کرنے لگے تو ہم نے ان کو حکم دیا کہ ذلیل بندر ہوجاؤ",
        "(اور اس وقت کو یاد کرو) جب تمہارے پروردگار نے (یہود کو) آگاہ کردیا تھا کہ وہ ان پر قیامت تک ایسے شخص کو مسلط رکھے گا جو انہیں بری بری تکلیفیں دیتا رہے۔ بےشک تمہارا پروردگار جلد عذاب کرنے والا ہے اور وہ بخشنے والا مہربان بھی ہے",
        "اور ہم نے ان کو جماعت جماعت کرکے ملک میں منتشر کر دیا۔ بعض ان میں سے نیکوکار ہیں اور بعض اور طرح کے (یعنی بدکار) اور ہم آسائشوں، تکلیفوں (دونوں) سے ان کی آزمائش کرتے رہے تاکہ (ہماری طرف) رجوع کریں",
        "پھر ان کے بعد ناخلف ان کے قائم مقام ہوئے جو کتاب کے وارث بنے۔ یہ (بےتامل) اس دنیائے دنی کا مال ومتاع لے لیتے ہیں اور کہتے ہیں کہ ہم بخش دیئے جائیں گے۔ اور (لوگ ایسوں پر طعن کرتے ہیں) اگر ان کے سامنے بھی ویسا ہی مال آجاتا ہے تو وہ بھی اسے لے لیتے ہیں۔ کیا ان سے کتاب کی نسبت عہد نہیں لیا گیا کہ خدا پر سچ کے سوا اور کچھ نہیں کہیں گے۔ اور جو کچھ اس (کتاب) میں ہے اس کو انہوں نے پڑھ بھی لیا ہے۔ اور آخرت کا گھر پرہیزگاروں کے لیے بہتر ہے کیا تم سمجھتے نہیں",
        "اور جو لوگ کتاب کو مضبوط پکڑے ہوئے ہیں اور نماز کا التزام رکھتے ہیں (ان کو ہم اجر دیں گے کہ) ہم نیکوکاروں کا اجر ضائع نہیں کرتے",
        "اور جب ہم نے ان (کے سروں) پر پہاڑ اٹھا کھڑا کیا گویا وہ سائبان تھا اور انہوں نے خیال کیا کہ وہ ان پر گرتا ہے تو (ہم نے کہا کہ) جو ہم نے تمہیں دیا ہے اسے زور سے پکڑے رہو۔ اور جو اس میں لکھا ہے اس پر عمل کرو تاکہ بچ جاؤ",
        "اور جب تمہارے پروردگار نے بنی آدم سے یعنی ان کی پیٹھوں سے ان کی اولاد نکالی تو ان سے خود ان کے مقابلے میں اقرار کرا لیا (یعنی ان سے پوچھا کہ) کیا تمہارا پروردگار نہیں ہوں۔ وہ کہنے لگے کیوں نہیں ہم گواہ ہیں (کہ تو ہمارا پروردگار ہے)۔ یہ اقرار اس لیے کرایا تھا کہ قیامت کے دن (کہیں یوں نہ) کہنے لگو کہ ہم کو تو اس کی خبر ہی نہ تھی",
        "یا یہ (نہ) کہو کہ شرک تو پہلے ہمارے بڑوں نے کیا تھا۔ اور ہم تو ان کی اولاد تھے (جو) ان کے بعد (پیدا ہوئے)۔ تو کیا جو کام اہل باطل کرتے رہے اس کے بدلے تو ہمیں ہلاک کرتا ہے",
        "اور اسی طرح ہم (اپنی) آیتیں کھول کھول کر بیان کرتے ہیں تاکہ یہ رجوع کریں",
        "اور ان کو اس شخص کا حال پڑھ کر سنا دو جس کو ہم نے اپنی آیتیں عطا فرمائیں (اور ہفت پارچہٴ علم شرائع سے مزین کیا) تو اس نے ان کو اتار دیا پھر شیطان اس کے پیچھے لگا تو وہ گمراہوں میں ہوگیا",
        "اور اگر ہم چاہتے تو ان آیتوں سے اس (کے درجے) کو بلند کر دیتے مگر وہ تو پستی کی طرف مائل ہوگیا اور اپنی خواہش کے پیچھے چل پڑا۔ تو اس کی مثال کتے کی سی ہوگئی کہ اگر سختی کرو تو زبان نکالے رہے اور یونہی چھوڑ دو تو بھی زبان نکالے رہے۔ یہی مثال ان لوگوں کی ہے جنہوں نے ہماری آیتوں کو جھٹلایا تو ان سے یہ قصہ بیان کردو۔ تاکہ وہ فکر کریں",
        "جن لوگوں نے ہماری آیتوں کی تکذیب کی ان کی مثال بری ہے اور انہوں نے نقصان (کیا تو) اپنا ہی کیا",
        "جس کو خدا ہدایت دے وہی راہ یاب ہے اور جس کو گمراہ کرے تو ایسے ہی لوگ نقصان اٹھانے والے ہیں",
        "اور ہم نے بہت سے جن اور انسان دوزخ کے لیے پیدا کیے ہیں۔ ان کے دل ہیں لیکن ان سے سمجھتے نہیں اور ان کی آنکھیں ہیں مگر ان سے دیکھتے نہیں اور ان کے کان ہیں پر ان سے سنتے نہیں۔ یہ لوگ بالکل چارپایوں کی طرح ہیں بلکہ ان سے بھی بھٹکے ہوئے۔ یہی وہ ہیں جو غفلت میں پڑے ہوئے ہیں",
        "اور خدا کے سب نام اچھے ہی اچھے ہیں۔ تو اس کو اس کے ناموں سے پکارا کرو اور جو لوگ اس کے ناموں میں کجی اختیار کرتے ہیں ان کو چھوڑ دو۔ وہ جو کچھ کر رہے ہیں عنقریب اس کی سزا پائیں گے",
        "اور ہماری مخلوقات میں سے ایک وہ لوگ ہیں جو حق کا رستہ بتاتے ہیں اور اسی کے ساتھ انصاف کرتے ہیں",
        "اور جن لوگوں نے ہماری آیتوں کو جھٹلایا ان کو بتدریج اس طریق سے پکڑیں گے کہ ان کو معلوم ہی نہ ہوگا",
        "اور میں ان کو مہلت دیئے جاتا ہوں میری تدبیر (بڑی) مضبوط ہے",
        "کیا انہوں نے غور نہیں کیا کہ ان کے رفیق محمد (ﷺ) کو (کسی طرح کا بھی) جنون نہیں ہے۔ وہ تو ظاہر ظہور ڈر سنانے والے ہیں",
        "کیا انہوں نے آسمان اور زمین کی بادشاہت میں جو چیزیں خدا نے پیدا کی ہیں ان پر نظر نہیں کی اور اس بات پر (خیال نہیں کیا) کہ عجب نہیں ان (کی موت) کا وقت نزدیک پہنچ گیا ہو۔ تو اس کے بعد وہ اور کس بات پر ایمان لائیں گے",
        "جس شخص کو خدا گمراہ کرے اس کو کوئی ہدایت دینے والا نہیں اور وہ ان (گمراہوں) کو چھوڑے رکھتا ہے کہ اپنی سرکشی میں پڑے بہکتے رہیں",
        "(یہ لوگ) تم سے قیامت کے بارے میں پوچھتے ہیں کہ اس کے واقع ہونے کا وقت کب ہے۔ کہہ دو کہ اس کا علم تو میرے پروردگار ہی کو ہے۔ وہی اسے اس کے وقت پر ظاہر کردےگا۔ وہ آسمان وزمین میں ایک بھاری بات ہوگی اور ناگہاں تم پر آجائے گی۔ یہ تم سے اس طرح دریافت کرتے ہیں کہ گویا تم اس سے بخوبی واقف ہو۔ کہو کہ اس کا علم تو خدا ہی کو ہے لیکن اکثر لوگ یہ نہیں جانتے",
        "کہہ دو کہ میں اپنے فائدے اور نقصان کا کچھ بھی اختیار نہیں رکھتا مگر جو الله چاہے اور اگر میں غیب کی باتیں جانتا ہوتا تو بہت سے فائدے جمع کرلیتا اور مجھ کو کوئی تکلیف نہ پہنچتی۔ میں تو مومنوں کو ڈر اور خوشخبری سنانے والا ہوں",
        "وہ خدا ہی تو ہے جس نے تم کو ایک شخص سے پیدا کیا اور اس سے اس کا جوڑا بنایا تاکہ اس سے راحت حاصل کرے۔ سو جب وہ اس کے پاس جاتا ہے تو اسے ہلکا سا حمل رہ جاتا ہے اور وہ اس کے ساتھ چلتی پھرتی ہے۔ پھر جب کچھ بوجھ معلوم کرتی یعنی بچہ پیٹ میں بڑا ہوتا ہے تو دونوں میاں بیوی اپنے پروردگار خدائے عزوجل سے التجا کرتے ہیں کہ اگر تو ہمیں صحیح وسالم (بچہ) دے گا تو ہم تیرے شکر گذار ہوں گے",
        "جب وہ ان کو صحیح و سالم (بچہ) دیتا ہے تو اس (بچے) میں جو وہ ان کو دیتا ہے اس کا شریک مقرر کرتے ہیں۔ جو وہ شرک کرتے ہیں (خدا کا رتبہ) اس سے بلند ہے",
        "کیا وہ ایسوں کو شریک بناتے ہیں جو کچھ بھی پیدا نہیں کرسکتے اور خود پیدا کیے جاتے ہیں",
        "اور نہ ان کی مدد کی طاقت رکھتے ہیں اور نہ اپنی ہی مدد کرسکتے ہیں",
        "اگر تم ان کو سیدھے رستے کی طرف بلاؤ تو تمہارا کہا نہ مانیں۔ تمہارے لیے برابر ہے کہ تم ان کو بلاؤ یا چپکے ہو رہو",
        "(مشرکو) جن کو تم خدا کے سوا پکارتے ہو وہ تمہاری طرح کے بندے ہی ہیں (اچھا) تم ان کو پکارو اگر سچے ہو تو چاہیئے کہ وہ تم کو جواب بھی دیں",
        "بھلا ان کے پاؤں ہیں جن سے چلیں یا ہاتھ ہیں جن سے پکڑیں یا آنکھیں ہیں جن سے دیکھیں یا کان ہیں جن سے سنیں؟ کہہ دو کہ اپنے شریکوں کو بلالو اور میرے بارے میں (جو) تدبیر (کرنی ہو) کرلو اور مجھے کچھ مہلت بھی نہ دو (پھر دیکھو کہ وہ میرا کیا کرسکتے ہیں)",
        "میرا مددگار تو خدا ہی ہے جس نے کتاب (برحق) نازل کی۔ اور نیک لوگوں کا وہی دوستدار ہے",
        "اور جن کو تم خدا کے سوا پکارتے ہو وہ نہ تمہاری ہی مدد کی طاقت رکھتے ہیں اور نہ خود ہی اپنی مدد کرسکتے ہیں",
        "اور اگر تم ان کو سیدھے رستے کی طرف بلاؤ تو سن نہ سکیں اور تم انہیں دیکھتے ہو کہ (بہ ظاہر) آنکھیں کھولے تمہاری طرف دیکھ رہے ہیں مگر (فی الواقع) کچھ نہیں دیکھتے",
        "(اے محمدﷺ) عفو اختیار کرو اور نیک کام کرنے کا حکم دو اور جاہلوں سے کنارہ کرلو",
        "اور اگر شیطان کی طرف سے تمہارے دل میں کسی طرح کا وسوسہ پیدا ہو تو خدا سے پناہ مانگو۔ بےشک وہ سننے والا (اور) سب کچھ جاننے والا ہے",
        "جو لوگ پرہیزگار ہیں جب ان کو شیطان کی طرف سے کوئی وسوسہ پیدا ہوتا ہے تو چونک پڑتے ہیں اور (دل کی آنکھیں کھول کر) دیکھنے لگتے ہیں",
        "اور ان (کفار) کے بھائی انہیں گمراہی میں کھینچے جاتے ہیں پھر (اس میں کسی طرح کی) کوتاہی نہیں کرتے",
        "اور جب تم ان کے پاس (کچھ دنوں تک) کوئی آیت نہیں لاتے تو کہتے ہیں کہ تم نے (اپنی طرف سے) کیوں نہیں بنالی۔ کہہ دو کہ میں تو اسی کی پیروی کرتا ہوں جو میرے پروردگار کی طرف سے میرے پاس آتا ہے۔ یہ قرآن تمہارے پروردگار کی جانب سے دانش وبصیرت اور مومنوں کے لیے ہدایت اور رحمت ہے",
        "اور جب قرآن پڑھا جائے تو توجہ سے سنا کرو اور خاموش رہا کرو تاکہ تم پر رحم کیا جائے",
        "اور اپنے پروردگار کو دل ہی دل میں عاجزی اور خوف سے اور پست آواز سے صبح وشام یاد کرتے رہو اور (دیکھنا) غافل نہ ہونا",
        "جو لوگ تمہارے پروردگار کے پاس ہیں وہ اس کی عبادت سے گردن کشی نہیں کرتے اور اس پاک ذات کو یاد کرتے اور اس کے آگے سجدے کرتے رہتے ہیں"
