        "O believers! Honour your obligations. All grazing livestock has been made lawful to you—except what is hereby announced to you and hunting while on pilgrimage. Indeed, Allah commands what He wills.",
        "O believers! Do not violate Allah’s rituals ˹of pilgrimage˺, the sacred months, the sacrificial animals, the ˹offerings decorated with˺ garlands, nor those ˹pilgrims˺ on their way to the Sacred House seeking their Lord’s bounty and pleasure. When pilgrimage has ended, you are allowed to hunt. Do not let the hatred of a people who once barred you from the Sacred Mosque provoke you to transgress. Cooperate with one another in goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is severe in punishment.",
        "Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, and swine; what is slaughtered in the name of any other than Allah; what is killed by strangling, beating, a fall, or by being gored to death; what is partly eaten by a predator unless you slaughter it; and what is sacrificed on altars. You are also forbidden to draw lots for decisions. This is all evil. Today the disbelievers have given up all hope of ˹undermining˺ your faith. So do not fear them; fear Me! Today I have perfected your faith for you, completed My favour upon you, and chosen Islam as your way. But whoever is compelled by extreme hunger—not intending to sin—then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "They ask you, ˹O Prophet,˺ what is permissible for them ˹to eat˺. Say, “What is good and lawful. Also what is caught by your hunting animals and birds of prey which you have trained as instructed by Allah. So eat what they catch for you, but mention the Name of Allah over it ˹first˺.” And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.",
        "Today all good, pure foods have been made lawful for you. Similarly, the food of the People of the Book is permissible for you and yours is permissible for them. And ˹permissible for you in marriage˺ are chaste believing women as well as chaste women of those given the Scripture before you—as long as you pay them their dowries in wedlock, neither fornicating nor taking them as mistresses. And whoever rejects the faith, all their good deeds will be void ˹in this life˺ and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers.",
        "O believers! When you rise up for prayer, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of ˹full˺ impurity, then take a full bath. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or have been intimate with your wives and cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean earth by wiping your faces and hands. It is not Allah’s Will to burden you, but to purify you and complete His favour upon you, so perhaps you will be grateful.",
        "Remember Allah’s favour upon you and the covenant He made with you when you said, “We hear and obey.” And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart.",
        "O believers! Stand firm for Allah and bear true testimony. Do not let the hatred of a people lead you to injustice. Be just! That is closer to righteousness. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",
        "Allah has promised those who believe and do good ˹His˺ forgiveness and a great reward.",
        "As for those who disbelieve and deny Our signs, they are the residents of the Hellfire.",
        "O believers! Remember Allah’s favour upon you: when a people sought to harm you, but He held their hands back from you. Be mindful of Allah. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.",
        "Allah made a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve leaders from among them and ˹then˺ said, “I am truly with you. If you establish prayer, pay alms-tax, believe in My messengers, support them, and lend to Allah a good loan, I will certainly forgive your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow. And whoever among you disbelieves afterwards has truly strayed from the Right Way.”",
        "But for breaking their covenant We condemned them and hardened their hearts. They distorted the words of the Scripture and neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold. You ˹O Prophet˺ will always find deceit on their part, except for a few. But pardon them and bear with them. Indeed, Allah loves the good-doers.",
        "And from those who say, “We are Christians,” We took their covenant, but they neglected a portion of what they had been commanded to uphold. So We let hostility and enmity arise between them until the Day of Judgment, and soon Allah will inform them of all they have done.",
        "O People of the Book! Now Our Messenger has come to you, revealing much of what you have hidden of the Scriptures and disregarding much. There certainly has come to you from Allah a light and a clear Book",
        "through which Allah guides those who seek His pleasure to the ways of peace, brings them out of darkness and into light by His Will, and guides them to the Straight Path.",
        "Indeed, those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have fallen into disbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Who has the power to prevent Allah if He chose to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, his mother, and everyone in the world all together?” To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He creates whatever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
        "The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of Allah and His most beloved!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Why then does He punish you for your sins? No! You are only humans like others of His Own making. He forgives whoever He wills and punishes whoever He wills. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. And to Him is the final return.”",
        "O People of the Book! Our Messenger has indeed come to you, making things clear to you after an interval between the messengers so you do not say, “There has never come to us a deliverer of good news or a warner.” Now there has come to you a deliverer of good news and a warner. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Remember Allah’s favours upon you when He raised prophets from among you, made you sovereign, and gave you what He had never given anyone in the world.",
        "O  my people! Enter the Holy Land which Allah has destined for you ˹to enter˺. And do not turn back or else you will become losers.”",
        "They replied, “O Moses! There is an enormously powerful people there, so we will never ˹be able to˺ enter it until they leave. If they do, then we will enter!”",
        "Two God-fearing men—who had been blessed by Allah—said, “Surprise them through the gate. If you do, you will certainly prevail. Put your trust in Allah if you are ˹truly˺ believers.”",
        "˹Yet˺ they said, “O Moses! ˹Still˺ we will never enter as long as they remain there. So go—both you and your Lord—and fight; we are staying right here!”",
        "Moses pleaded, “My Lord! I have no control over anyone except myself and my brother. So set us apart from the rebellious people.”",
        "Allah replied, “Then this land is forbidden to them for forty years, during which they will wander through the land. So do not grieve for the rebellious people.”",
        "Relate to them in truth ˹O Prophet˺ the story of Adam’s two sons—how each offered a sacrifice: Abel’s offering was accepted while Cain’s was not. So Cain threatened, “I will kill you!” His brother replied, “Allah only accepts ˹the offering˺ of the sincerely devout.",
        "If you raise your hand to kill me, I will not raise mine to kill you, because I fear Allah—the Lord of all worlds.",
        "I want to let you bear your sin against me along with your other sins, then you will be one of those destined to the Fire. And that is the reward of the wrongdoers.”",
        "Yet Cain convinced himself to kill his brother, so he killed him—becoming a loser.",
        "Then Allah sent a crow digging ˹a grave˺ in the ground ˹for a dead crow˺, in order to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother. He cried, “Alas! Have I ˹even˺ failed to be like this crow and bury the corpse of my brother?” So he became regretful.",
        "That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity. ˹Although˺ Our messengers already came to them with clear proofs, many of them still transgressed afterwards through the land.",
        "Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread mischief in the land is death, crucifixion, cutting off their hands and feet on opposite sides, or exile from the land. This ˹penalty˺ is a disgrace for them in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.",
        "As for those who repent before you seize them, then know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "O believers! Be mindful of Allah and seek what brings you closer to Him and struggle in His Way, so you may be successful.",
        "As for the disbelievers, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over ˹and offer it all˺ to ransom themselves from the punishment of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted from them. And they will suffer a painful punishment.",
        "They will be desperate to get out of the Fire but they will never be able to. And they will suffer an everlasting punishment.",
        "As for male and female thieves, cut off their hands for what they have done—a deterrent from Allah. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
        "But whoever repents after their wrongdoing and mends their ways, Allah will surely turn to them in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah ˹alone˺? He punishes whoever He wills and forgives whoever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
        "O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those who say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief. Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever Allah allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against Allah. It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.",
        "They eagerly listen to falsehood and consume forbidden gain. So if they come to you ˹O Prophet˺, either judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you whatsoever. But if you judge between them, then do so with justice. Surely Allah loves those who are just.",
        "But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers.",
        "Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to Allah’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. So do not fear the people; fear Me! Nor trade my revelations for a fleeting gain. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the disbelievers.",
        "We ordained for them in the Torah, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth—and for wounds equal retaliation.” But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for them. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers.",
        "Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.",
        "So let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what Allah has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious.",
        "We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ this Book with the truth, as a confirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If Allah had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To Allah you will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your differences.",
        "And judge between them ˹O Prophet˺ by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their desires. And beware, so they do not lure you away from some of what Allah has revealed to you. If they turn away ˹from Allah’s judgment˺, then know that it is Allah’s Will to repay them for some of their sins, and that many people are indeed rebellious.",
        "Is it the judgment of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance they seek? Who could be a better judge than Allah for people of sure faith?",
        "O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as guardians—they are guardians of each other. Whoever does so will be counted as one of them. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
        "You see those with sickness in their hearts racing for their guardianship, saying ˹in justification˺, “We fear a turn of fortune will strike us.” But perhaps Allah will bring about ˹your˺ victory or another favour by His command, and they will regret what they have hidden in their hearts.",
        "˹Only then,˺ the believers will ask ˹one another˺, “Are these the ones who swore solemn oaths by Allah that they were with you?” Their deeds have been in vain, so they have become losers.",
        "O believers! Whoever among you abandons their faith, Allah will replace them with others who love Him and are loved by Him. They will be humble with the believers but firm towards the disbelievers, struggling in the Way of Allah; fearing no blame from anyone. This is the favour of Allah. He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.",
        "Your only guardians are Allah, His Messenger, and fellow believers—who establish prayer and pay alms-tax with humility.",
        "Whoever allies themselves with Allah, His Messenger, and fellow believers, then it is certainly Allah’s party that will prevail.",
        "O believers! Do not seek the guardianship of those given the Scripture before you and the disbelievers who have made your faith a mockery and amusement. And be mindful of Allah if you are ˹truly˺ believers.",
        "When you call to prayer, they mock it in amusement. This is because they are a people without understanding.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! Do you resent us only because we believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before—while most of you are rebellious?”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall I inform you of those who deserve a worse punishment from Allah ˹than the rebellious˺? It is those who earned Allah’s condemnation and displeasure—some being reduced to apes and pigs and worshippers of false gods. These are far worse in rank and farther astray from the Right Way.”",
        "When they come to you ˹believers˺ they say, “We believe.” But they are committed to disbelief when they enter and when they leave. And Allah knows what they hide.",
        "You see many of them racing towards sin, transgression, and consumption of forbidden gain. Evil indeed are their actions!",
        "Why do their rabbis and scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and consuming what is unlawful? Evil indeed is their inaction!",
        "˹Some among˺ the Jews said, “Allah is tight-fisted.” May their fists be tied and they be condemned for what they said. Rather, He is open-handed, giving freely as He pleases. That which has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ from your Lord will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. We have stirred among them hostility and hatred until the Day of Judgment. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah puts it out. And they strive to spread corruption in the land. And Allah does not like corruptors.",
        "Had the People of the Book only been faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, We would have certainly absolved them of their sins and admitted them into the Gardens of Bliss.",
        "And had they observed the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord, they would have been overwhelmed with provisions from above and below. Some among them are upright, yet many do nothing but evil.",
        "O Messenger! Convey everything revealed to you from your Lord. If you do not, then you have not delivered His message. Allah will ˹certainly˺ protect you from the people. Indeed, Allah does not guide the people who disbelieve.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O People of the Book! You have nothing to stand on unless you observe the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.” And your Lord’s revelation to you ˹O Prophet˺ will only cause many of them to increase in wickedness and disbelief. So do not grieve for the people who disbelieve.",
        "Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians and Christians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
        "Indeed, We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Whenever a messenger came to them with what they did not desire, they denied some and killed others.",
        "They thought there would be no consequences, so they turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. Yet Allah turned to them in forgiveness ˹after their repentance˺, but again many became blind and deaf. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",
        "Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. The Messiah ˹himself˺ said, “O Children of Israel! Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever associates others with Allah ˹in worship˺ will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.",
        "Those who say, “Allah is one in a Trinity,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. There is only One God. If they do not stop saying this, those who disbelieve among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment.",
        "Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. ˹Many˺ messengers had ˹come and˺ gone before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both ate food. See how We make the signs clear to them, yet see how they are deluded ˹from the truth˺!",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How can you worship besides Allah those who can neither harm nor benefit you? And Allah ˹alone˺ is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.”",
        "Say, “O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes in your faith beyond the truth, nor follow the vain desires of those who went astray before ˹you˺. They misled many and strayed from the Right Way.”",
        "The disbelievers among the Children of Israel were condemned in the revelations of David and Jesus, son of Mary. That was for their disobedience and violations.",
        "They did not forbid one another from doing evil. Evil indeed was what they did!",
        "You see many of them taking the disbelievers as allies. Truly wicked are their misdeeds, which have earned them Allah’s wrath. And they will be in everlasting torment.",
        "Had they believed in Allah, the Prophet, and what has been revealed to him, they would have never taken those ˹pagans˺ as allies. But most of them are rebellious.",
        "You will surely find the most bitter towards the believers to be the Jews and polytheists and the most gracious to be those who call themselves Christian. That is because there are priests and monks among them and because they are not arrogant.",
        "When they listen to what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears for recognizing the truth. They say, “Our Lord! We believe, so count us among the witnesses.",
        "Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? And we long for our Lord to include us in the company of the righteous.”",
        "So Allah will reward them for what they said with Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. And that is the reward of the good-doers.",
        "As for those who disbelieve and reject Our signs, they will be the residents of the Hellfire.",
        "O believers! Do not forbid the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors.",
        "Eat of the good, lawful things provided to you by Allah. And be mindful of Allah in Whom you believe.",
        "Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes things clear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful.",
        "O believers! Intoxicants, gambling, idols, and drawing lots for decisions are all evil of Satan’s handiwork. So shun them so you may be successful.",
        "Satan’s plan is to stir up hostility and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from remembering Allah and praying. Will you not then abstain?",
        "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware! But if you turn away, then know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺ clearly.",
        "There is no blame on those who believe and do good for what they had consumed before ˹the prohibition˺, as long as they fear Allah, have faith, and do what is good; then they believe and act virtuously, then become fully mindful ˹of Allah˺ and do righteous deeds. For Allah loves the good-doers.",
        "O believers! Allah will surely test you with game within the reach of your hands and spears to distinguish those who fear Him in secret. Whoever transgresses from now on will suffer a painful punishment.",
        "O  believers! Do not kill game while on pilgrimage. Whoever kills game intentionally must compensate by offering its equivalence—as judged by two just men among you—to be offered at the Sacred House, or by feeding the needy, or by fasting so that they may taste the consequences of their violations. Allah has forgiven what has been done. But those who persist will be punished by Allah. And Allah is Almighty, capable of punishment.",
        "It is lawful for you to hunt and eat seafood, as a provision for you and for travellers. But hunting on land is forbidden to you while on pilgrimage. Be mindful of Allah to Whom you all will be gathered.",
        "Allah has made the Ka’bah—the Sacred House—a sanctuary of well-being for all people, along with the sacred months, the sacrificial animals, and the ˹offerings decorated with˺ garlands. All this so you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and that He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of everything.",
        "Know that Allah is severe in punishment and that He is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "The Messenger’s duty is only to deliver ˹the message˺. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows what you reveal and what you conceal.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Good and evil are not equal, though you may be dazzled by the abundance of evil. So be mindful of Allah, O  people of reason, so you may be successful.”",
        "O believers! Do not ask about any matter which, if made clear to you, may disturb you. But if you inquire about what is being revealed in the Quran, it will be made clear to you. Allah has forgiven what was done ˹in the past˺. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.",
        "Some people before you asked such questions then denied their answers.",
        "Allah has never ordained the ˹so-called˺ baḥîrah, sâ'ibah, waṣîlah, and ḥâm camels. But the disbelievers just fabricate lies about Allah, and most of them lack understanding.",
        "When it is said to them, “Come to Allah’s revelations and to the Messenger,” they reply, “What we found our forefathers practicing is good enough for us.” ˹Would they still do so,˺ even if their forefathers had absolutely no knowledge or guidance?",
        "O believers! You are accountable only for yourselves. It will not harm you if someone chooses to deviate—as long as you are ˹rightly˺ guided. To Allah you will all return, and He will inform you of what you used to do.",
        "O believers! When death approaches any of you, call upon two just Muslim men to witness as you make a bequest; otherwise, two non-Muslims if you are afflicted with death while on a journey. If you doubt ˹their testimony˺, keep them after prayer and let them testify under oath ˹saying˺, “By Allah! We would never sell our testimony for any price, even in favour of a close relative, nor withhold the testimony of Allah. Otherwise, we would surely be sinful.”",
        "If they are found guilty ˹of false testimony˺, let the deceased’s two closest heirs affected by the bequest replace the witnesses and testify under oath ˹saying˺, “By Allah! Our testimony is truer than theirs. We have not transgressed. Otherwise, we would surely be wrongdoers.”",
        "In this way it is more likely that witnesses will give true testimony or else fear that their oaths could be refuted by those of the heirs. Be mindful of Allah and obey. For Allah does not guide the rebellious people.",
        "˹Consider˺ the Day Allah will gather the messengers and say, “What response did you receive?” They will reply, “We have no knowledge ˹compared to You˺! You ˹alone˺ are indeed the Knower of all unseen.”",
        "And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour upon you and your mother: how I supported you with the holy spirit so you spoke to people in ˹your˺ infancy and adulthood. How I taught you writing, wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel. How you moulded a bird from clay—by My Will—and breathed into it and it became a ˹real˺ bird—by My Will. How you healed the blind and the lepers—by My Will. How you brought the dead to life—by My Will. How I prevented the Children of Israel from harming you when you came to them with clear proofs and the disbelievers among them said, “This is nothing but pure magic.”",
        "And how I inspired the disciples, “Believe in Me and My messenger!” They declared, “We believe and bear witness that we fully submit ˹to Allah˺.”",
        "˹Remember˺ when the disciples asked, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Would your Lord be willing to send down to us a table spread with food from heaven?” Jesus answered, “Fear Allah if you are ˹truly˺ believers.”",
        "They said, “We ˹only˺ wish to eat from it to reassure our hearts, to verify you are indeed truthful to us, and to become its witnesses.”",
        "Jesus, son of Mary, prayed, “O Allah, our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread with food as a feast for us—the first and last of us—and as a sign from You. Provide for us! You are indeed the Best Provider.”",
        "Allah answered, “I am sending it down to you. But whoever among you denies afterwards will be subjected to a torment I have never inflicted on anyone of My creation.”",
        "And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?” He will answer, “Glory be to You! How could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known it. You know what is ˹hidden˺ within me, but I do not know what is within You. Indeed, You ˹alone˺ are the Knower of all unseen.",
        "I never told them anything except what You ordered me to say: “Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord!” And I was witness over them as long as I remained among them. But when You took me, You were the Witness over them—and You are a Witness over all things.",
        "If You punish them, they belong to You after all. But if You forgive them, You are surely the Almighty, All-Wise.”",
        "Allah will declare, “This is the Day when ˹only˺ the faithful will benefit from their faithfulness. Theirs are Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the ultimate triumph.”",
        "To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything within. And He is Most Capable of everything."

        "يا ايها الذين امنوا لا تسالوا عن اشياء ان تبد لكم تسؤكم وان تسالوا عنها حين ينزل القران تبد لكم عفا الله عنها والله غفور حليم",
        "قد سالها قوم من قبلكم ثم اصبحوا بها كافرين",
        "ما جعل الله من بحيرة ولا سائبة ولا وصيلة ولا حام ولكن الذين كفروا يفترون على الله الكذب واكثرهم لا يعقلون",
        "واذا قيل لهم تعالوا الى ما انزل الله والى الرسول قالوا حسبنا ما وجدنا عليه اباءنا اولو كان اباؤهم لا يعلمون شيئا ولا يهتدون",

        "فان عثر على انهما استحقا اثما فاخران يقومان مقامهما من الذين استحق عليهم الاوليان فيقسمان بالله لشهادتنا احق من شهادتهما وما اعتدينا انا اذا لمن الظالمين",
        "ذلك ادنى ان ياتوا بالشهادة على وجهها او يخافوا ان ترد ايمان بعد ايمانهم واتقوا الله واسمعوا والله لا يهدي القوم الفاسقين",

        "واذ اوحيت الى الحواريين ان امنوا بي وبرسولي قالوا امنا واشهد باننا مسلمون",
        "اذ قال الحواريون يا عيسى ابن مريم هل يستطيع ربك ان ينزل علينا مائدة من السماء قال اتقوا الله ان كنتم مؤمنين",

        "اور یہود اور نصاریٰ کہتے ہیں کہ ہم خدا کے بیٹے اور اس کے پیارے ہیں کہو کہ پھر وہ تمہاری بداعمالیوں کے سبب تمھیں عذاب کیوں دیتا ہے (نہیں) بلکہ تم اس کی مخلوقات میں (دوسروں کی طرح کے) انسان ہو وہ جسے چاہے بخشے اور جسے چاہے عذاب دے اور آسمان زمین اور جو کچھ ان دونوں میں ہے سب پر خدا ہی کی حکومت ہے اور (سب کو) اسی کی طرف لوٹ کر جانا ہے",
        "اے اہلِ کتاب پیغمبروں کے آنے کا سلسلہ جو (ایک عرصے تک) منقطع رہا تو (اب) تمہارے پاس ہمارے پیغمبر آ گئے ہیں جو تم سے (ہمارے احکام) بیان کرتے ہیں تاکہ تم یہ نہ کہو کہ ہمارے پاس کوئی خوشخبری یا ڈر سنانے والا نہیں آیا سو (اب) تمہارے پاس خوشخبری اور ڈر سنانے والے آ گئے ہیں اور خدا ہر چیز پر قادر ہے",
        "اور جب موسیٰ نے اپنی قوم سے کہا کہ بھائیو تم پر خدا نے جو احسان کئے ہیں ان کو یاد کرو کہ اس نے تم میں پیغمبر پیدا کیے اور تمہیں بادشاہ بنایا اور تم کو اتنا کچھ عنایت کیا کہ اہل عالم میں سے کسی کو نہیں دیا",
        "تو بھائیو! تم ارض مقدس (یعنی ملک شام) میں جسے خدا نے تمہارے لیے لکھ رکھا ہے چل داخل ہو اور (دیکھنا مقابلے کے وقت) پیٹھ نہ پھیر دینا ورنہ نقصان میں پڑ جاؤ گے",
        "وہ کہنے لگے کہ موسیٰ! وہاں تو بڑے زبردست لوگ (رہتے) ہیں اور جب تک وہ اس سرزمین سے نکل نہ جائیں ہم وہاں جا نہیں سکتے ہاں اگر وہ وہاں سے نکل جائیں تو ہم جا داخل ہوں گے",
        "جو لوگ (خدا سے) ڈرتے تھے ان میں سے دو شخص جن پر خدا کی عنایت تھی کہنے لگے کہ ان لوگوں پر دروازے کے رستے سے حملہ کردو جب تم دروازے میں داخل ہو گئے تو فتح تمہارے ہے اور خدا ہی پر بھروسہ رکھو بشرطیکہ صاحبِ ایمان ہو",
        "وہ بولے کہ موسیٰ! جب تک وہ لوگ وہاں ہیں ہم کبھی وہاں نہیں جا سکتے (اگر لڑنا ہی ضرور ہے) تو تم اور تمہارا خدا جاؤ اور لڑو ہم یہیں بیٹھے رہیں گے",
        "موسیٰ نے (خدا سے) التجا کی کہ پروردگار میں اپنے اور اپنے بھائی کے سوا اور کسی پر اختیار نہیں رکھتا تو ہم میں اور ان نافرمان لوگوں میں جدائی کردے",
        "خدا نے فرمایا کہ وہ ملک ان پر چالیس برس تک کے لیے حرام کر دیا گیا (کہ وہاں جانے نہ پائیں گے اور جنگل کی) زمین میں سرگرداں پھرتے رہیں گے تو ان نافرمان لوگوں کے حال پر افسوس نہ کرو",
        "اور (اے محمد) ان کو آدم کے دو بیٹوں (ہابیل اور قابیل) کے حالات (جو بالکل) سچے (ہیں) پڑھ کر سنا دو کہ جب ان دونوں نے خدا (کی جناب میں) کچھ نیازیں چڑھائیں تو ایک کی نیاز تو قبول ہو گئی اور دوسرے کی قبول نہ ہوئی (تب قابیل ہابیل سے) کہنے لگا کہ میں تجھے قتل کروں گا اس نے کہا کہ خدا پرہیزگاروں ہی کی (نیاز) قبول فرمایا کرتا ہے",
        "اور اگر تو مجھے قتل کرنے کے لیے مجھ پر ہاتھ چلائے گا تو میں تجھ کو قتل کرنے کے لئے تجھ پر ہاتھ نہیں چلاؤں گا مجھے تو خدائے رب العالمین سے ڈر لگتا ہے",

        "مگر اس کے نفس نے اس کو بھائی کے قتل ہی کی ترغیب دی تو اس نے اسے قتل کر دیا اور خسارہ اٹھانے والوں میں ہو گیا",
        "اب خدا نے ایک کوّا بھیجا جو زمین کریدنے لگا تاکہ اسے دکھائے کہ اپنے بھائی کی لاش کو کیونکر چھپائے کہنے لگا اے ہے مجھ سے اتنا بھی نہ ہو سکا کہ اس کوے کے برابر ہوتا کہ اپنے بھائی کی لاش چھپا دیتا پھر وہ پشیمان ہوا",
        "اس قتل کی وجہ سے ہم نے بنی اسرائیل پر یہ حکم نازل کیا کہ جو شخص کسی کو (ناحق) قتل کرے گا (یعنی) بغیر اس کے کہ جان کا بدلہ لیا جائے یا ملک میں خرابی کرنے کی سزا دی جائے اُس نے گویا تمام لوگوں کو قتل کیا اور جو اس کی زندگانی کا موجب ہوا تو گویا تمام لوگوں کی زندگانی کا موجب ہوا اور ان لوگوں کے پاس ہمارے پیغمبر روشن دلیلیں لا چکے ہیں پھر اس کے بعد بھی ان سے بہت سے لوگ ملک میں حدِ اعتدال سے نکل جاتے ہیں",
        "جو لوگ خدا اور اس کے رسول سے لڑائی کریں اور ملک میں فساد کرنے کو دوڑتے پھریں ان کی یہی سزا ہے کہ قتل کر دیئے جائیں یا سولی چڑھا دیئے جائیں یا ان کے ایک ایک طرف کے ہاتھ اور ایک ایک طرف کے پاؤں کاٹ دیئے جائیں یا ملک سے نکال دیئے جائیں یہ تو دنیا میں ان کی رسوائی ہے اور آخرت میں ان کے لیے بڑا (بھاری) عذاب تیار ہے",
        "ہاں جن لوگوں نے اس سے پیشتر کہ تمہارے قابو میں آ جائیں توبہ کر لی تو جان رکھو کہ خدا بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "اے ایمان والو! خدا سے ڈرتے رہو اور اس کا قرب حاصل کرنے کا ذریعہ تلاش کرتے رہو اور اس کے رستے میں جہاد کرو تاکہ رستگاری پاؤ",
        "جو لوگ کافر ہیں اگر ان کے پاس روئے زمین (کے تمام خزانے اور اس) کا سب مال ومتاع ہو اور اس کے ساتھ اسی قدر اور بھی ہو تاکہ قیامت کے روز عذاب (سے رستگاری حاصل کرنے) کا بدلہ دیں تو ان سے قبول نہیں کیا جائے گا اور ان کو درد دینے والا عذاب ہوگا",
        "(ہر چند) چاہیں گے کہ آگ سے نکل جائیں مگر اس سے نہیں نکل سکیں گے اور ان کے لئے ہمیشہ کا عذاب ہے",
        "اور جو چوری کرے مرد ہو یا عورت ان کے ہاتھ کاٹ ڈالو یہ ان کے فعلوں کی سزا اور خدا کی طرف سے عبرت ہے اور خدا زبردست (اور) صاحب حکمت ہے",
        "اور جو شخص گناہ کے بعد توبہ کرے اور نیکوکار ہو جائے تو خدا اس کو معاف کر دے گا کچھ شک نہیں کہ خدا بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "کیا تم کو معلوم نہیں کہ آسمانوں اور زمین میں خدا ہی کی سلطنت ہے؟ جس کو چاہے عذاب کرے اور جسے چاہے بخش دے اور خدا ہر چیز پر قادر ہے",
        "اے پیغمبر! جو لوگ کفر میں جلدی کرتے ہیں (کچھ تو) ان میں سے (ہیں) جو منہ سے کہتے ہیں کہ ہم مومن ہیں لیکن ان کے دل مومن نہیں ہیں اور (کچھ) ان میں سے جو یہودی ہیں ان کی وجہ سے غمناک نہ ہونا یہ غلط باتیں بنانے کے لیے جاسوسی کرتے پھرتے ہیں اور ایسے لوگوں (کے بہکانے) کے لیے جاسوس بنے ہیں جو ابھی تمہارے پاس نہیں آئے (صحیح) باتوں کو ان کے مقامات (میں ثابت ہونے) کے بعد بدل دیتے ہیں (اور لوگوں سے) کہتے ہیں کہ اگر تم کو یہی (حکم) ملے تو اسے قبول کر لینا اور اگر یہ نہ ملے تو اس سے احتراز کرنا اور اگر کسی کو خدا گمراہ کرنا چاہے تو اس کے لیے تم کچھ بھی خدا سے (ہدایت کا) اختیار نہیں رکھتے یہ وہ لوگ ہیں جن کے دلوں کو خدا نے پاک کرنا نہیں چاہا ان کے لیے دنیا میں بھی ذلت ہے اور آخرت میں بھی بڑا عذاب ہے",
        "(یہ) جھوٹی باتیں بنانے کے جاسوسی کرنے والے اور (رشوت کا) حرام مال کھانے والے ہیں اگر یہ تمہارے پاس (کوئی مقدمہ فیصل کرانے کو) آئیں تو تم ان میں فیصلہ کر دینا یا اعراض کرنا اور اگر ان سے اعراض کرو گے تو وہ تمہارا کچھ بھی نہیں بگاڑ سکیں گے اور اگر فیصلہ کرنا چاہو تو انصاف کا فیصلہ کرنا کہ خدا انصاف کرنے والوں کو دوست رکھتا ہے",
        "اور یہ تم سے (اپنے مقدمات) کیونکر فیصل کرایں گے جبکہ خود ان کے پاس تورات (موجود) ہے جس میں خدا کا حکم (لکھا ہوا) ہے (یہ اسے جانتے ہیں) پھر اس کے بعد اس سے پھر جاتے ہیں اور یہ لوگ ایمان ہی نہیں رکھتے",
        "بیشک ہم نے توریت نازل فرمائی جس میں ہدایت اور روشنی ہے اسی کے مطابق انبیاء جو (خدا کے) فرمانبردار تھے یہودیوں کو حکم دیتے رہے ہیں اور مشائخ اور علماء بھی کیونکہ وہ کتاب خدا کے نگہبان مقرر کیے گئے تھے اور اس پر گواہ تھے (یعنی حکم الہٰی کا یقین رکھتے تھے) تو تم لوگوں سے مت ڈرنا اور مجھی سے ڈرتے رہنا اور میری آیتوں کے بدلے تھوڑی سی قیمت نہ لینا اور جو خدا کے نازل فرمائے ہوئے احکام کے مطابق حکم نہ دے تو ایسے ہی لوگ کافر ہیں",
        "اور ہم نے ان لوگوں کے لیے تورات میں یہ حکم لکھ دیا تھا کہ جان کے بدلے جان اور آنکھ کے بدلے آنکھ اور ناک کے بدلے ناک اور کان کے بدلے کان اور دانت کے بدلے دانت اور سب زخموں کا اسی طرح بدلہ ہے لیکن جو شخص بدلہ معاف کر دے وہ اس کے لیے کفارہ ہوگا اور جو خدا کے نازل فرمائے ہوئے احکام کے مطابق حکم نہ دے تو ایسے ہی لوگ بےانصاف ہیں",
        "اور ان پیغمبروں کے بعد انہی کے قدموں پر ہم نے عیسیٰ بن مریم کو بھیجا جو اپنے سے پہلے کی کتاب تورات کی تصدیق کرتے تھے اور ان کو انجیل عنایت کی جس میں ہدایت اور نور ہے اور تورات کی جو اس سے پہلی کتاب (ہے) تصدیق کرتی ہے اور پرہیزگاروں کو راہ بتاتی اور نصیحت کرتی ہے",
        "اور اہل انجیل کو چاہیئے کہ جو احکام خدا نے اس میں نازل فرمائے ہیں اس کے مطابق حکم دیا کریں اور جو خدا کے نازل کئے ہوئے احکام کے مطابق حکم نہ دے گا تو ایسے لوگ نافرماں ہیں",
        "اور (اے پیغمبر!) ہم نے تم پر سچی کتاب نازل کی ہے جو اپنے سے پہلی کتابوں کی تصدیق کرتی ہے اور ان (سب) پر شامل ہے تو جو حکم خدا نے نازل فرمایا ہے اس کے مطابق ان کا فیصلہ کرنا اور حق جو تمہارے پاس آچکا ہے اس کو چھوڑ کر ان کی خواہشوں کی پیروی نہ کرنا ہم نے تم میں سے ہر ایک (فرقے) کے لیے ایک دستور اور طریقہ مقرر کیا ہے اور اگر خدا چاہتا تو سب کو ایک ہی شریعت پر کر دیتا مگر جو حکم اس نے تم کو دیئے ہیں ان میں وہ تمہاری آزمائش کرنی چاہتا ہے سو نیک کاموں میں جلدی کرو تم سب کو خدا کی طرف لوٹ کر جانا ہے پھر جن باتوں میں تم کو اختلاف تھا وہ تم کو بتا دے گا",
        "اور (ہم پھر تاکید کرتے ہیں کہ) جو (حکم) خدا نے نازل فرمایا ہے اسی کے مطابق ان میں فیصلہ کرنا اور ان کی خواہشوں کی پیروی نہ کرنا اور ان سے بچتے رہنا کہ کسی حکم سے جو خدا نے تم پر نازل فرمایا ہے یہ کہیں تم کو بہکانہ دیں اگر یہ نہ مانیں تو جان لو کہ خدا چاہتا ہے کہ ان کے بعض گناہوں کے سبب ان پر مصیبت نازل کرے اور اکثر لوگ تو نافرمان ہیں",
        "کیا یہ زمانہٴ جاہلیت کے حکم کے خواہش مند ہیں؟ اور جو یقین رکھتے ہیں ان کے لیے خدا سے اچھا حکم کس کا ہے؟",
        "اے ایمان والو! یہود اور نصاریٰ کو دوست نہ بناؤ یہ ایک دوسرے کے دوست ہیں اور جو شخص تم میں سے ان کو دوست بنائے گا وہ بھی انہیں میں سے ہوگا بیشک خدا ظالم لوگوں کو ہدایت نہیں دیتا",
        "تو جن لوگوں کے دلوں میں (نفاق کا) مرض ہے تم ان کو دیکھو گے کہ ان میں دوڑ دوڑ کے ملے جاتے ہیں کہتے ہیں کہ ہمیں خوف ہے کہ کہیں ہم پر زمانے کی گردش نہ آجائے سو قریب ہے کہ خدا فتح بھیجے یا اپنے ہاں سے کوئی اور امر (نازل فرمائے) پھر یہ اپنے دل کی باتوں پر جو چھپایا کرتے تھے پشیمان ہو کر رہ جائیں گے",
        "اور اس (وقت) مسلمان (تعجب سے) کہیں گے کہ کیا یہ وہی ہیں جو خدا کی سخت سخت قسمیں کھایا کرتے تھے کہ ہم تمہارے ساتھ ہیں ان کےعمل اکارت گئے اور وہ خسارے میں پڑ گئے",
        "اے ایمان والو اگر کوئی تم میں سے اپنے دین سے پھر جائے گا تو خدا ایسے لوگ پیدا کر دے گا جن کو وہ دوست رکھے اور جسے وہ دوست رکھیں اور جو مومنوں کے حق میں نرمی کریں اور کافروں سے سختی سے پیش آئیں خدا کی راہ میں جہاد کریں اور کسی ملامت کرنے والی کی ملامت سے نہ ڈریں یہ خدا کا فضل ہے وہ جسے چاہتا ہے دیتا ہے اور الله بڑی کشائش والا اور جاننے والا ہے",
        "تمہارے دوست تو خدا اور اس کے پیغمبر اور مومن لوگ ہی ہیں جو نماز پڑھتے اور زکوٰة دیتے اور (خدا کے آگے) جھکتے ہیں",
        "اور جو شخص خدا اور اس کے پیغمبر اور مومنوں سے دوستی کرے گا تو (وہ خدا کی جماعت میں داخل ہوگا اور) خدا کی جماعت ہی غلبہ پانے والی ہے",

        "اور جب تم لوگ نماز کے لیے اذان دیتے ہو تو یہ اسے بھی ہنسی اور کھیل بناتے ہیں یہ اس لیے کہ سمجھ نہیں رکھتے",
        "کہو کہ اے اہل کتاب! تم ہم میں برائی ہی کیا دیکھتے ہو سوا اس کے کہ ہم خدا پر اور جو (کتاب) ہم پر نازل ہوئی اس پر اور جو (کتابیں) پہلے نازل ہوئیں ان پر ایمان لائے ہیں اور تم میں اکثر بدکردار ہیں",
        "کہو کہ میں تمہیں بتاؤں کہ خدا کے ہاں اس سے بھی بدتر جزا پانے والے کون ہیں؟ وہ لوگ ہیں جن پر خدا نے لعنت کی اور جن پر وہ غضبناک ہوا اور (جن کو) ان میں سے بندر اور سور بنا دیا اور جنہوں نے شیطان کی پرستش کی ایسے لوگوں کا برا ٹھکانہ ہے اور وہ سیدھے رستے سے بہت دور ہیں",
        "اور جب یہ لوگ تمہارے پاس آتے ہیں تو کہتے ہیں کہ ہم ایمان لے آئے حالانکہ کفر لے کر آتے ہیں اور اسی کو لیکر جاتے ہیں اور جن باتوں کو یہ مخفی رکھتے ہیں خدا ان کو خوب جانتا ہے",
        "اور تم دیکھو گے کہ ان میں اکثر گناہ اور زیادتی اور حرام کھانے میں جلدی کر رہے ہیں بےشک یہ جو کچھ کرتے ہیں برا کرتے ہیں",
        "بھلا ان کے مشائخ اور علماء انہیں گناہ کی باتوں اور حرام کھانے سے منع کیوں نہیں کرتے؟ بلاشبہ وہ بھی برا کرتے ہیں",
        "اور یہود کہتے ہیں کہ خدا کا ہاتھ (گردن سے) بندھا ہوا ہے (یعنی الله بخیل ہے) انہیں کے ہاتھ باندھے جائیں اور ایسا کہنے کے سبب ان پر لعنت ہو (اس کا ہاتھ بندھا ہوا نہیں) بلکہ اس کے دونوں ہاتھ کھلے ہیں وہ جس طرح (اور جتنا) چاہتا ہے خرچ کرتا ہے اور (اے محمد) یہ (کتاب) جو تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے تم پر نازل ہوئی اس سے ان میں سے اکثر کی شرارت اور انکار اور بڑھے گا اور ہم نے ان کے باہم عداوت اور بغض قیامت تک کے لیے ڈال دیا ہے یہ جب لڑائی کے لیے آگ جلاتے ہیں خدا اس کو بجھا دیتا ہے اور یہ ملک میں فساد کے لیے دوڑے پھرتے ہیں اور خدا فساد کرنے والوں کو دوست نہیں رکھتا",
        "اور اگر اہل کتاب ایمان لاتے اور پرہیز گاری کرتے تو ہم ان سے ان کے گناہ محو کر دیتے اور ان کو نعمت کے باغوں میں داخل کرتے",

        "اے پیغمبر جو ارشادات خدا کی طرف سے تم پر نازل ہوئے ہیں سب لوگوں کو پہنچا دو اور اگر ایسا نہ کیا تو تم خدا کے پیغام پہنچانے میں قاصر رہے (یعنی پیغمبری کا فرض ادا نہ کیا) اور خدا تم کو لوگوں سے بچائے رکھے گا بیشک خدا منکروں کو ہدایت نہیں دیتا",
        "کہو کہ اے اہل کتاب! جب تک تم تورات اور انجیل کو اور جو (اور کتابیں) تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے تم لوگوں پر نازل ہوئیں ان کو قائم نہ رکھو گے کچھ بھی راہ پر نہیں ہو سکتے اور یہ (قرآن) جو تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے تم پر نازل ہوا ہے ان میں سے اکثر کی سرکشی اور کفر اور بڑھے گا تو تم قوم کفار پر افسوس نہ کرو",
        "جو لوگ خدا پر اور روز آخرت پر ایمان لائیں گے اور عمل نیک کریں گے خواہ وہ مسلمان ہوں یا یہودی یا ستارہ پرست یا عیسائی ان کو (قیامت کے دن) نہ کچھ خوف ہو گا اور نہ غمناک ہوں گے",
        "ہم نے بنی اسرائیل سے عہد بھی لیا اور ان کی طرف پیغمبر بھی بھیجے (لیکن) جب کوئی پیغمبر ان کے پاس ایسی باتیں لےکر آتا جن کو ان کے دل نہیں چاہتے تھے تو وہ (انبیاء کی) ایک جماعت کو تو جھٹلا دیتے اور ایک جماعت کو قتل کر دیتے تھے",
        "اور خیال کرتے تھے کہ (اس سے ان پر) کوئی آفت نہیں آنے کی تو وہ اندھے اور بہرے ہو گئے پھر خدا نے ان پر مہربانی فرمائی (لیکن) پھر ان میں سے بہت سے اندھے اور بہرے ہو گئے اور خدا ان کے سب کاموں کو دیکھ رہا ہے",
        "وہ لوگ بےشبہ کافر ہیں جو کہتے ہیں کہ مریم کے بیٹے (عیسیٰ) مسیح خدا ہیں حالانکہ مسیح یہود سے یہ کہا کرتے تھے کہ اے بنی اسرائیل خدا ہی کی عبادت کرو جو میرا بھی پروردگار ہے اور تمہارا بھی (اور جان رکھو کہ) جو شخص خدا کے ساتھ شرک کرے گا خدا اس پر بہشت حرام کر دے گا اور اس کا ٹھکانہ دوزخ ہے اور ظالموں کا کوئی مددگار نہیں",
        "وہ لوگ (بھی) کافر ہیں جو اس بات کے قائل ہیں کہ خدا تین میں کا تیسرا ہے حالانکہ اس معبود یکتا کے سوا کوئی عبادت کے لائق نہیں اگر یہ لوگ ایسے اقوال (وعقائد) سے باز نہیں آئیں گے تو ان میں جو کافر ہوئے ہیں وہ تکلیف دینے والا عذاب پائیں گے",
        "تو یہ کیوں خدا کے آگے توبہ نہیں کرتے اور اس سے گناہوں کی معافی نہیں مانگتے اور خدا تو بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "مسیح ابن مریم تو صرف (خدا) کے پیغمبر تھے ان سے پہلے بھی بہت سے رسول گزر چکے تھے اور ان کی والدہ (مریم خدا کی) ولی اور سچی فرمانبردار تھیں دونوں (انسان تھے اور) کھانا کھاتے تھے دیکھو ہم ان لوگوں کے لیے اپنی آیتیں کس طرح کھول کھول کر بیان کرتے ہیں پھر (یہ) دیکھو کہ یہ کدھر الٹے جا رہے ہیں",
        "کہو کہ تم خدا کے سوا ایسی چیز کی کیوں پرستش کرتے ہو جس کو تمہارے نفع اور نقصان کا کچھ بھی اختیار نہیں؟ اور خدا ہی (سب کچھ) سنتا جانتا ہے",

        "جو لوگ بنی اسرائیل میں کافر ہوئے ان پر داؤد اور عیسیٰ بن مریم کی زبان سے لعنت کی گئی یہ اس لیے کہ نافرمانی کرتے تھے اور حد سے تجاوز کرتے تھے",

        "تم ان میں سے بہتوں کو دیکھو گے کہ کافروں سے دوستی رکھتے ہیں انہوں نے جو کچھ اپنے واسطے آگے بھیجا ہے برا ہے (وہ یہ) کہ خدا ان سے ناخوش ہوا اور وہ ہمیشہ عذاب میں (مبتلا) رہیں گے",
        "اور اگر وہ خدا پر اور پیغمبر پر اور جو کتاب ان پر نازل ہوئی تھی اس پر یقین رکھتے تو ان لوگوں کو دوست نہ بناتے لیکن ان میں اکثر بدکردار ہیں",
        "(اے پیغمبرﷺ!) تم دیکھو گے کہ مومنوں کے ساتھ سب سے زیادہ دشمنی کرنے والے یہودی اور مشرک ہیں اور دوستی کے لحاظ سے مومنوں سے قریب تر ان لوگوں کو پاؤ گے جو کہتے ہیں کہ ہم نصاریٰ ہیں یہ اس لیے کہ ان میں عالم بھی ہیں اور مشائخ بھی اور وہ تکبر نہیں کرتے",
        "اور جب اس (کتاب) کو سنتے ہیں جو (سب سے پہلے) پیغمبر (محمدﷺ) پر نازل ہوئی تو تم دیکھتے ہو کہ ان کی آنکھوں سے آنسو جاری ہو جاتے ہیں اس لیے کہ انہوں نے حق بات پہچان لی اور وہ (خدا کی جناب میں) عرض کرتے ہیں کہ اے پروردگار ہم ایمان لے آئے تو ہم کو ماننے والوں میں لکھ لے",
        "اور ہمیں کیا ہوا ہے کہ خدا پر اور حق بات پر جو ہمارے پاس آئی ہے ایمان نہ لائیں اور ہم امید رکھتے ہیں کہ پروردگار ہم کو نیک بندوں کے ساتھ (بہشت میں) داخل کرے گا",

        "مومنو! ایسی چیزوں کے بارے میں مت سوال کرو کہ اگر (ان کی حقیقتیں) تم پر ظاہر کر دی جائیں تو تمہیں بری لگیں اور اگر قرآن کے نازل ہونے کے ایام میں ایسی باتیں پوچھو گے تو تم پر ظاہر بھی کر دی جائیں گی (اب تو) خدا نے ایسی باتوں (کے پوچھنے) سے درگزر فرمایا ہے اور خدا بخشنے والا بردبار ہے",
        "اس طرح کی باتیں تم سے پہلے لوگوں نے بھی پوچھی تھیں (مگر جب بتائی گئیں تو) پھر ان سے منکر ہو گئے",
        "خدا نے نہ تو بحیرہ کچھ چیز بنایا ہے اور نہ سائبہ اور نہ وصیلہ اور نہ حام بلکہ کافر خدا پر جھوٹ افترا کرتے ہیں اور یہ اکثر عقل نہیں رکھتے",
        "اور جب ان لوگوں سے کہا جاتا ہے کہ جو (کتاب) خدا نے نازل فرمائی ہے اس کی اور رسول الله کی طرف رجوع کرو تو کہتے ہیں کہ جس طریق پر ہم نے اپنے باپ دادا کو پایا ہے وہی ہمیں کافی ہے بھلا اگر ان کے باپ دادا نہ تو کچھ جانتے ہوں اور نہ سیدھے رستے پر ہوں (تب بھی؟)",
        "اے ایمان والو! اپنی جانوں کی حفاظت کرو جب تم ہدایت پر ہو تو کوئی گمراہ تمہارا کچھ بھی بگاڑ نہیں سکتا تم سب کو خدا کی طرف لوٹ کر جانا ہے اس وقت وہ تم کو تمہارے سب کاموں سے جو (دنیا میں) کئے تھے آگاہ کرے گا (اور ان کا بدلہ دے گا)",
        "مومنو! جب تم میں سے کسی کی موت آموجود ہو تو شہادت (کا نصاب) یہ ہے کہ وصیت کے وقت تم (مسلمانوں) میں سے دو عادل (یعنی صاحب اعتبار) گواہ ہوں یا اگر (مسلمان نہ ملیں اور) تم سفر کر رہے ہو اور (اس وقت) تم پر موت کی مصیبت واقع ہو تو کسی دوسرے مذہب کے دو (شخصوں کو) گواہ (کر لو) اگر تم کو ان گواہوں کی نسبت کچھ شک ہو تو ان کو (عصر کی) نماز کے بعد کھڑا کرو اور دونوں خدا کی قسمیں کھائیں کہ ہم شہادت کا کچھ عوض نہیں لیں گے گو ہمارا رشتہ دار ہی ہو اور نہ ہم الله کی شہادت کو چھپائیں گے اگر ایسا کریں گے تو گنہگار ہوں گے",
        "پھر اگر معلوم ہو جائے کہ ان دونوں نے (جھوٹ بول کر) گناہ حاصل کیا ہے تو جن لوگوں کا انہوں نے حق مارنا چاہا تھا ان میں سے ان کی جگہ اور دو گواہ کھڑے ہوں جو (میت سے) قرابت قریبہ رکھتے ہوں پھر وہ خدا کی قسمیں کھائیں کہ ہماری شہادت ان کی شہادت سے بہت اچھی ہے اور ہم نے کوئی زیادتی نہیں کی ایسا کیا ہو تو ہم بےانصاف ہیں",
        "اس طریق سے بہت قریب ہے کہ یہ لوگ صحیح صحیح شہادت دیں یا اس بات سے خوف کریں کہ (ہماری) قسمیں ان کی قسموں کے بعد رد کر دی جائیں گی اور خدا سے ڈرو اور اس کے حکموں کو (گوشِ ہوش سے) سنو اور خدا نافرمان لوگوں کو ہدایت نہیں دیتا",
        "(وہ دن یاد رکھنے کے لائق ہے) جس دن خدا پیغمبروں کو جمع کرے گا پھر ان سے پوچھے گا کہ تمہیں کیا جواب ملا تھا وہ عرض کریں گے کہ ہمیں کچھ معلوم نہیں توہی غیب کی باتوں سے واقف ہے",
        "جب خدا (عیسیٰ سے) فرمائے گا کہ اے عیسیٰ بن مریم! میرے ان احسانوں کو یاد کرو جو میں نے تم پر اور تمہاری والدہ پر کئے جب میں نے روح القدس (یعنی جبرئیل) سے تمہاری مدد کی تم جھولے میں اور جوان ہو کر (ایک ہی نسق پر) لوگوں سے گفتگو کرتے تھے اور جب میں نے تم کو کتاب اور دانائی اور تورات اور انجیل سکھائی اور جب تم میرے حکم سے مٹی کا جانور بنا کر اس میں پھونک مار دیتے تھے تو وہ میرے حکم سے اڑنے لگتا تھا اور مادر زاد اندھے اور سفید داغ والے کو میرے حکم سے چنگا کر دیتے تھے اور مردے کو میرے حکم سے (زندہ کرکے قبر سے) نکال کھڑا کرتے تھے اور جب میں نے بنی اسرائیل (کے ہاتھوں) کو تم سے روک دیا جب تم ان کے پاس کھلے نشان لے کر آئے تو جو ان میں سے کافر تھے کہنے لگے کہ یہ صریح جادو ہے",
        "اور جب میں نے حواریوں کی طرف حکم بھیجا کہ مجھ پر اور میرے پیغمبر پر ایمان لاؤ وہ کہنے لگے کہ (پروردگار) ہم ایمان لائے تو شاہد رہیو کہ ہم فرمانبردار ہیں",
        "(وہ قصہ بھی یاد کرو) جب حواریوں نے کہا کہ اے عیسیٰ بن مریم! کیا تمہارا پروردگار ایسا کر سکتا ہے کہ ہم پر آسمان سے (طعام کا) خوان نازل کرے؟ انہوں نے کہا کہ اگر ایمان رکھتے ہو تو خدا سے ڈرو",
        "وہ بولے کہ ہماری یہ خواہش ہے کہ ہم اس میں سے کھائیں اور ہمارے دل تسلی پائیں اور ہم جان لیں کہ تم نے ہم سے سچ کہا ہے اور ہم اس (خوان کے نزول) پر گواہ رہیں",
        "(تب) عیسیٰ بن مریم نے دعا کی کہ اے ہمارے پروردگار! ہم پر آسمان سے خوان نازل فرما کہ ہمارے لیے (وہ دن) عید قرار پائے یعنی ہمارے اگلوں اور پچھلوں (سب) کے لیے اور وہ تیری طرف سے نشانی ہو اور ہمیں رزق دے تو بہتر رزق دینے والا ہے",
        "خدا نے فرمایا میں تم پر ضرور خوان نازل فرماؤں گا لیکن جو اس کے بعد تم میں سے کفر کرے گا اسے ایسا عذاب دوں گا کہ اہل عالم میں کسی کو ایسا عذاب نہ دوں گا",
        "اور (اس وقت کو بھی یاد رکھو) جب خدا فرمائے گا کہ اے عیسیٰ بن مریم! کیا تم نے لوگوں سے کہا تھا کہ خدا کے سوا مجھے اور میری والدہ کو معبود مقرر کرو؟ وہ کہیں گے کہ تو پاک ہے مجھے کب شایاں تھا کہ میں ایسی بات کہتا جس کا مجھے کچھ حق نہیں اگر میں نے ایسا کہا ہوگا تو تجھ کو معلوم ہوگا (کیونکہ) جو بات میرے دل میں ہے تو اسے جانتا ہے اور جو تیرے ضمیر میں ہے اسے میں نہیں جانتا بےشک تو علاّم الغیوب ہے",
        "میں نے ان سے کچھ نہیں کہا بجز اس کے جس کا تو نے مجھے حکم دیا ہے وہ یہ کہ تم خدا کی عبادت کرو جو میرا اور تمہارا سب کا پروردگار ہے اور جب تک میں ان میں رہا ان (کے حالات) کی خبر رکھتا رہا جب تو نے مجھے دنیا سے اٹھا لیا تو تو ان کا نگران تھا اور تو ہر چیز سے خبردار ہے",
        "اگر تو ان کو عذاب دے تو یہ تیرے بندے ہیں اور اگر بخش دے تو (تیری مہربانی ہے) بےشک تو غالب اور حکمت والا ہے",
        "خدا فرمائے گا کہ آج وہ دن ہے کہ راست بازوں کو ان کی سچائی ہی فائدہ دے گی ان کے لئے باغ ہیں جن کے نیچے نہریں بہہ رہی ہیں ابدالآباد ان میں بستے رہیں گے خدا ان سے خوش ہے اور وہ خدا سے خوش ہیں یہ بڑی کامیابی ہے",
        "آسمان اور زمین اور جو کچھ ان (دونوں) میں ہے سب پر خدا ہی کی بادشاہی ہے اور وہ ہر چیز پر قادر ہے"
