        "We have not revealed the Quran to you ˹O Prophet˺ to cause you distress",
        "but as a reminder to those in awe ˹of Allah˺.",
        "˹It is˺ a revelation from the One Who created the earth and the high heavens—",
        "the Most Compassionate, ˹Who is˺ established on the Throne.",
        "To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and whatever is in between and whatever is underground.",
        "Whether you speak openly ˹or not˺, He certainly knows what is secret and what is even more hidden.",
        "Allah—there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He has the Most Beautiful Names.",
        "Has the story of Moses reached you ˹O Prophet˺?",
        "When he saw a fire, he said to his family, “Wait here, ˹for˺ I have spotted a fire. Perhaps I can bring you a torch from it, or find some guidance at the fire.”",
        "But when he approached it, he was called, “O Moses!",
        "It is truly I. I am your Lord! So take off your sandals, for you are in the sacred valley of Ṭuwa.",
        "I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed:",
        "‘It is truly I. I am Allah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Me. So worship Me ˹alone˺, and establish prayer for My remembrance.",
        "The Hour is sure to come. My Will is to keep it hidden, so that every soul may be rewarded according to their efforts.",
        "So do not let those who disbelieve in it and follow their desires distract you from it, or you will be doomed.’”",
        "˹Allah added,˺ “And what is that in your right hand, O  Moses?”",
        "He replied, “It is my staff! I lean on it, and with it I beat down ˹branches˺ for my sheep, and have other uses for it.”",
        "Allah said, “Throw it down, O  Moses!”",
        "So he did, then—behold!—it became a serpent, slithering.",
        "Allah said, “Take it, and have no fear. We will return it to its former state.",
        "And put your hand under your armpit, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished, as another sign",
        "so that We may show you some of Our greatest signs.",
        "Go to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺.”",
        "Moses prayed, “My Lord! Uplift my heart for me",
        "and make my task easy",
        "and remove the impediment from my tongue",
        "so people may understand my speech",
        "and grant me a helper from my family",
        "Aaron, my brother.",
        "Strengthen me through him",
        "and let him share my task",
        "so that we may glorify You much",
        "and remember You much",
        "for truly You have ˹always˺ been overseeing us.”",
        "Allah responded, “All that you requested has been granted, O  Moses!",
        "And surely We had shown You favour before",
        "when We inspired your mother with this:",
        "‘Put him into a chest, then put it into the river. The river will wash it ashore, and he will be taken by ˹Pharaoh,˺ an enemy of Mine and his.’ And I blessed you with lovability from Me ˹O Moses˺ so that you would be brought up under My ˹watchful˺ Eye.",
        "˹Remember˺ when your sister came along and proposed, ‘Shall I direct you to someone who will nurse him?’ So We reunited you with your mother so that her heart would be put at ease, and she would not grieve. ˹Later˺ you killed a man ˹by mistake˺, but We saved you from sorrow, as well as other tests We put you through. Then you stayed for a number of years among the people of Midian. Then you came here as pre-destined, O  Moses!",
        "And I have selected you for My service.",
        "Go forth, you and your brother, with My signs and never falter in remembering Me.",
        "Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has truly transgressed ˹all bounds˺.",
        "Speak to him gently, so perhaps he may be mindful ˹of Me˺ or fearful ˹of My punishment˺.”",
        "They both pleaded, “Our Lord! We fear that he may be quick to harm us or act tyrannically.”",
        "Allah reassured ˹them˺, “Have no fear! I am with you, hearing and seeing.",
        "So go to him and say, ‘Indeed we are both messengers from your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not oppress them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And salvation will be for whoever follows the ˹right˺ guidance.",
        "It has indeed been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies ˹the truth˺ and turns away.’”",
        "Pharaoh asked, “Who then is the Lord of you two, O  Moses?”",
        "He answered, “Our Lord is the One Who has given everything its ˹distinctive˺ form, then guided ˹it˺.”",
        "Pharaoh asked, “And what about previous peoples?”",
        "He replied, “That knowledge is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord neither falters nor forgets ˹anything˺.”",
        "˹He is the One˺ Who has laid out the earth for ˹all of˺ you, and set in it pathways for you, and sends down rain from the sky, causing various types of plants to grow",
        "˹so˺ eat and graze your cattle. Surely in this are signs for people of sound judgment.",
        "From the earth We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will bring you back again.",
        "And We certainly showed Pharaoh all of Our signs, but he denied them and refused ˹to believe˺.",
        "He said, “Have you come to drive us out of our land with your magic, O  Moses?",
        "We can surely meet you with similar magic. So set for us an appointment that neither of us will fail to keep, in a central place.”",
        "Moses said, “Your appointment is on the Day of the Festival, and let the people be gathered mid-morning.”",
        "Pharaoh then withdrew, orchestrated his scheme, then returned.",
        "Moses warned the magicians, “Woe to you! Do not fabricate a lie against Allah, or He will wipe you out with a torment. Whoever fabricates ˹lies˺ is bound to fail.”",
        "So the magicians disputed the matter among themselves, conversing privately.",
        "They concluded, “These two are only magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic, and do away with your most cherished traditions.",
        "So orchestrate your plan, then come forward in ˹perfect˺ ranks. And whoever prevails today will certainly be successful.”",
        "They said, “O Moses! Either you cast, or let us be the first to cast.”",
        "Moses responded, “No, you go first.” And suddenly their ropes and staffs appeared to him—by their magic—to be slithering.",
        "So Moses concealed fear within himself.",
        "We reassured ˹him˺, “Do not fear! It is certainly you who will prevail.",
        "Cast what is in your right hand, and it will swallow up what they have made, for what they have made is no more than a magic trick. And magicians can never succeed wherever they go.”",
        "So the magicians fell down in prostration, declaring, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”",
        "Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught you magic. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. You will really see whose punishment is more severe and more lasting.”",
        "They responded, “By the One Who created us! We will never prefer you over the clear proofs that have come to us. So do whatever you want! Your authority only covers the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world.",
        "Indeed, we have believed in our Lord so He may forgive our sins and that magic you have forced us to practice. And Allah is far superior ˹in reward˺ and more lasting ˹in punishment˺.”",
        "Whoever comes to their Lord as an evildoer will certainly have Hell, where they can neither live nor die.",
        "But whoever comes to Him as a believer, having done good, they will have the highest ranks:",
        "the Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, where they will stay forever. That is the reward of those who purify themselves.",
        "And We surely inspired Moses, ˹saying,˺ “Leave with My servants ˹at night˺ and strike a dry passage for them across the sea. Have no fear of being overtaken, nor be concerned ˹of drowning˺.”",
        "Then Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers—but how overwhelming were the waters that submerged them!",
        "And ˹so˺ Pharaoh led his people astray, and did not guide ˹them rightly˺.",
        "O Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemy, and made an appointment with you on the right side of Mount Ṭûr, and sent down to you manna and quails",
        "˹saying,˺ “Eat from the good things We have provided for you, but do not transgress in them, or My wrath will befall you. And whoever My wrath befalls is certainly doomed.",
        "But I am truly Most Forgiving to whoever repents, believes, and does good, then persists on ˹true˺ guidance.”",
        "˹Allah asked,˺ “Why have you come with such haste ahead of your people, O  Moses?”",
        "He replied, “They are close on my tracks. And I have hastened to You, my Lord, so You will be pleased.”",
        "Allah responded, “We have indeed tested your people in your absence, and the Sâmiri has led them astray.”",
        "So Moses returned to his people, furious and sorrowful. He said, “O my people! Had your Lord not made you a good promise? Has my absence been too long for you? Or have you wished for wrath from your Lord to befall you, so you broke your promise to me?”",
        "They argued, “We did not break our promise to you of our own free will, but we were made to carry the burden of the people’s ˹golden˺ jewellery, then we threw it ˹into the fire˺, and so did the Sâmiri.”",
        "Then he moulded for them an idol of a calf that made a lowing sound. They said, “This is your god and the god of Moses, but Moses forgot ˹where it was˺!”",
        "Did they not see that it did not respond to them, nor could it protect or benefit them?",
        "Aaron had already warned them beforehand, “O my people! You are only being tested by this, for indeed your ˹one true˺ Lord is the Most Compassionate. So follow me and obey my orders.”",
        "They replied, “We will not cease to worship it until Moses returns to us.”",
        "Moses scolded ˹his brother˺, “O Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them going astray",
        "from following after me? How could you disobey my orders?”",
        "Aaron pleaded, “O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard or ˹the hair of˺ my head. I really feared that you would say, ‘You have caused division among the Children of Israel, and did not observe my word.’”",
        "Moses then asked, “What did you think you were doing, O  Sâmiri?”",
        "He said, “I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful ˹of dust˺ from the hoof-prints of ˹the horse of˺ the messenger-angel ˹Gabriel˺ then cast it ˹on the moulded calf˺. This is what my lower-self tempted me into.”",
        "Moses said, “Go away then! And for ˹the rest of your˺ life you will surely be crying, ‘Do not touch ˹me˺!’ Then you will certainly have a fate that you cannot escape. Now look at your god to which you have been devoted: we will burn it up, then scatter it in the sea completely.”",
        "˹Then Moses addressed his people,˺ “Your only god is Allah, there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He encompasses everything in ˹His˺ knowledge.”",
        "This is how We relate to you ˹O Prophet˺ some of the stories of the past. And We have certainly granted you a Reminder from Us.",
        "Whoever turns away from it will surely bear the burden ˹of sin˺ on the Day of Judgment",
        "suffering its consequences forever. What an evil burden they will carry on Judgment Day!",
        "˹Beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and We will gather the wicked on that Day blue-faced ˹from horror and thirst˺.",
        "They will whisper among themselves, “You stayed no more than ten days ˹on the earth˺.”",
        "We know best what they will say—the most reasonable of them will say, “You stayed no more than a day.”",
        "And ˹if˺ they ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the mountains, ˹then˺ say, “My Lord will wipe them out completely",
        "leaving the earth level and bare",
        "with neither depressions nor elevations to be seen.”",
        "On that Day all will follow the caller ˹for assembly˺, ˹and˺ none will dare to deviate. All voices will be hushed before the Most Compassionate. Only whispers will be heard.",
        "On that Day no intercession will be of any benefit, except by those granted permission by the Most Compassionate and whose words are agreeable to Him.",
        "He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them, but they cannot encompass Him in ˹their˺ knowledge.",
        "And all faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, All-Sustaining. And those burdened with wrongdoing will be in loss.",
        "But whoever does good and is a believer will have no fear of being wronged or denied ˹their reward˺.",
        "And so We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran and varied the warnings in it, so perhaps they will shun evil or it may cause them to be mindful.",
        "Exalted is Allah, the True King! Do not rush to recite ˹a revelation of˺ the Quran ˹O Prophet˺ before it is ˹properly˺ conveyed to you, and pray, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.”",
        "And indeed, We once made a covenant with Adam, but he forgot, and ˹so˺ We did not find determination in him.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who refused ˹arrogantly˺.",
        "So We cautioned, “O Adam! This is surely an enemy to you and to your wife. So do not let him drive you both out of Paradise, for you ˹O Adam˺ would then suffer ˹hardship˺.",
        "Here it is guaranteed that you will never go hungry or unclothed",
        "nor will you ˹ever˺ suffer from thirst or ˹the sun’s˺ heat.”",
        "But Satan whispered to him, saying, “O Adam! Shall I show you the Tree of Immortality and a kingdom that does not fade away?”",
        "So they both ate from the tree and then their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise. So Adam disobeyed his Lord, and ˹so˺ lost his way.",
        "Then his Lord chose him ˹for His grace˺, accepted his repentance, and guided him ˹rightly˺.",
        "Allah said, “Descend, both of you, from here together ˹with Satan˺ as enemies to each other. Then when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray ˹in this life˺ nor suffer ˹in the next˺.",
        "But whoever turns away from My Reminder will certainly have a miserable life, then We will raise them up blind on the Day of Judgment.”",
        "They will cry, “My Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, although I used to see?”",
        "Allah will respond, “It is so, just as Our revelations came to you and you neglected them, so Today you are neglected.”",
        "This is how We reward whoever transgresses and does not believe in the revelations of their Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is far more severe and more lasting.",
        "Is it not yet clear to them how many peoples We destroyed before them, whose ruins they still pass by? Surely in this are signs for people of sound judgment.",
        "Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ and a term already set, their ˹instant˺ doom would have been inevitable.",
        "So be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And glorify the praises of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset, and glorify Him in the hours of the night and at both ends of the day, so that you may be pleased ˹with the reward˺.",
        "Do not let your eyes crave what We have allowed some of the disbelievers to enjoy; the ˹fleeting˺ splendour of this worldly life, which We test them with. But your Lord’s provision ˹in the Hereafter˺ is far better and more lasting.",
        "Bid your people to pray, and be diligent in ˹observing˺ it. We do not ask you to provide. It is We Who provide for you. And the ultimate outcome is ˹only˺ for ˹the people of˺ righteousness.",
        "They demand, “If only he could bring us a sign from his Lord!” Have they not ˹already˺ received a confirmation of what is in earlier Scriptures?",
        "Had We destroyed them with a torment before this ˹Prophet came˺, they would have surely argued, “Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations before being humiliated and put to shame.”",
        "Say ˹to them, O  Prophet˺, “Each ˹of us˺ is waiting, so keep waiting! You will soon know who is on the Straight Path and is ˹rightly˺ guided.”"

        "অতঃপর ফির‘আউন উঠে গেল। তারপর সে তার কৌশল একত্র করল, তারপর সে আসল।",
        "মূসা তাদেরকে বলল, ‘তোমাদের দুর্ভাগ্য! তোমরা আল্লাহর প্রতি মিথ্যা আরোপ করো না। করলে তিনি আযাব দ্বারা তোমাদেরকে সমূলে ধ্বংস করে দেবেন। আর যে ব্যক্তি মিথ্যা আরোপ করে, সে-ই ব্যর্থ হয়।",
        "তখন তারা নিজদের মধ্যে তাদের কর্ম সম্বন্ধে বাক-বিতন্ডা করল এবং তারা গোপনে পরামর্শ করল।",

        "‘কাজেই তোমরা তোমাদের কলা-কৌশল জমা কর। তারপর তোমরা সবাই সারিবদ্ধভাবে আস। আর আজ যে বিজয়ী হবে, সে-ই সফল হবে’।",
        "তারা বলল, হে মূসা, হয় তুমি নিক্ষেপ কর, না হয় আমরাই প্রথমে নিক্ষেপ করি।",
        "মূসা বলল, ‘বরং তোমরাই নিক্ষেপ কর। অতঃপর তাদের যাদুর প্রভাবে মূসার কাছে মনে হল যেন তাদের রশি ও লাঠিগুলো ছুটোছুটি করছে।",

        "অতঃপর যাদুকরেরা সিজদায় লুটিয়ে পড়ল। তারা বলল, ‘আমরা হারূন ও মূসার রবের প্রতি ঈমান আনলাম’।",
        "ফির‘আউন বলল, ‘কী, আমি তোমাদেরকে অনুমতি দেয়ার আগেই তোমরা তার প্রতি ঈমান আনলে? নিশ্চয় সে-ই তোমাদের প্রধান, যে তোমাদেরকে যাদু শিখিয়েছে। সুতরাং আমি অবশ্যই তোমাদের হাত ও পা বিপরীত দিক থেকে কেটে ফেলব এবং আমি তোমাদেরকে খেজুর গাছের কান্ডে শূলিবিদ্ধ করবই। আর তোমরা অবশ্যই জানতে পারবে, আমাদের মধ্যে কার আযাব বেশী কঠোর এবং বেশী স্থায়ী।",
        "তারা বলল, ‘আমাদের নিকট যে সকল স্পষ্ট নিদর্শন এসেছে এবং যিনি আমাদেরকে সৃষ্টি করেছেন, তার উপর আমরা তোমাকে কিছুতেই প্রাধান্য দেব না। সুতরাং তুমি যা ফয়সালা করতে চাও, তাই করো। তুমিতো কেবল এ দুনিয়ার জীবনের উপর কর্তৃত্ব করতে পার’।",
        "‘নিশ্চয় আমরা আমাদের রবের প্রতি ঈমান এনেছি, যাতে তিনি আমাদের অপরাধসমূহ এবং যে যাদু তুমি আমাদেরকে করতে বাধ্য করেছ, তা ক্ষমা করে দেন। আর আল্লাহ সর্বশ্রেষ্ঠ ও চিরস্থায়ী’।",
        "যে তার রবের নিকট অপরাধী অবস্থায় আসবে, তার জন্য রয়েছে জাহান্নাম। সেখানে সে মরবেও না, বাঁচবেও না।",
        "আর যারা তাঁর নিকট আসবে মুমিন অবস্থায়, সৎকর্ম করে তাদের জন্যই রয়েছে সুউচ্চ মর্যাদা।",
        "স্থায়ী জান্নাত, যার পাদদেশে নদী প্রবাহিত, তারা সেখানে স্থায়ী হবে। আর এটা হল যারা পরিশুদ্ধ হয় তাদের পুরষ্কার।",
        "আর আমি অবশ্যই মূসার কাছে ওহী প্রেরণ করেছিলাম যে, ‘আমার বান্দাদেরকে নিয়ে রাতের বেলায় রওয়ানা হও। অতঃপর সজোরে আঘাত করে তাদের জন্য শুকনো রাস্তা বানাও। পেছন থেকে ধরে ফেলার আশংকা করো না এবং ভয়ও করো না’।",
        "তারপর ফির‘আউন তার সেনাবাহিনী সহ তাদের পিছু নিল। অতঃপর সমুদ্র তাদেরকে সম্পূর্ণরূপে নিমজ্জিত করল।",
        "আর ফির‘আউন তার কওমকে পথভ্রষ্ট করেছিল এবং সে সঠিক পথ দেখায়নি।",
        "হে বনী ইসরাঈল, আমিই তোমাদেরকে তোমাদের শত্রু থেকে নাজাত দিয়েছি। আর তোমাদেরকে ওয়াদা দিয়েছিলাম তূর পাহাড়ের ডান পাশের* এবং আমি তোমাদের জন্য অবতরণ করেছিলাম ‘মান্না’ ও ‘সালওয়া’। \n* তারা তূর পাহাড়ের ডানপার্শ্বে উপস্থিত হলে আল্লাহ তা‘আলা তাদেরকে তাওরাত কিতাব প্রদান করবেন বলে ওয়াদা করেছিলেন।",
        "আমি তোমাদেরকে যে রিয্ক দান করেছি তা থেকে ভালগুলো খাও এবং এতে সীমালংঘন করো না। করলে তোমাদের উপর আমার গযব পতিত হবে। আর যার উপর আমার গযব পতিত হয় সে অবশ্যই ধ্বংস হয়।",
        "আর অবশ্যই আমি তার প্রতি ক্ষমাশীল, যে তাওবা করে, ঈমান আনে এবং সৎকর্ম করে অতঃপর সৎ পথে চলতে থাকে।",
        "হে মূসা, কিসে তাড়াতাড়ি নিয়ে এসেছে তোমাকে, তোমার কওমকে পেছনে ফেলে?",
        "মূসা বলল, ‘এই তো তারা আমার পিছনে। হে আমার রব, আমি তাড়াতাড়ি করে আপনার নিকট এসেছি, যাতে আপনি আমার উপর সন্তুষ্ট হন’।",
        "আল্লাহ বললেন, ‘তোমার চলে আসার পর আমি তো তোমার কওমকে পরীক্ষায় ফেলে দিয়েছি। আর সামেরী তাদেরকে পথভ্রষ্ট করেছে’।",
        "তারপর মূসা ক্রোধ ও দুঃখভরে তার কওমের কাছে ফিরে গেল। সে বলল, ‘হে কওম, তোমাদের রব কি তোমাদের সাথে এক উত্তম ওয়াদা করেননি? তোমাদের কাছে কি সেই ওয়াদার সময় দীর্ঘ হয়ে গেছে? নাকি তোমরা চেয়েছ যে, তোমাদের উপর তোমাদের রবের গযব পতিত হোক? তাই তোমরা আমার সাথে কৃত ওয়াদা ভঙ্গ করলে’?",
        "তারা বলল, ‘আমরা তো স্বেচ্ছায় আপনার সাথে কৃত ওয়াদা ভঙ্গ করিনি, বরং কওমের অলংকারের বোঝা আমাদের উপর চাপিয়ে দেয়া হয়েছিল। তাই আমরা তা (আগুনে) নিক্ষেপ করেছি, অনুরূপভাবে সামেরীও ফেলে দিয়েছে’।",
        "তারপর সে তাদের জন্য একটা গো বাছুরের প্রতিকৃতি বের করে আনল, যার ছিল আওয়াজ। তখন তারা বলল, ‘এটাই তোমাদের ইলাহ এবং মূসারও ইলাহ; কিন্তু সে এ কথা ভুলে গেছে’।",
        "তারা কি দেখে না যে, এটা তাদের কোন কথার জবাব দিতে পারে না, আর তাদের কোন ক্ষতি বা উপকার করার ক্ষমতাও রাখে না?",
        "আর হারূন পূর্বেই তাদেরকে বলেছিল, ‘হে আমার কওম, এটা দ্বারা তো কেবল তোমাদেরকে পরীক্ষায় ফেলা হয়েছে। আর তোমাদের রব তো পরম করুণাময়। তাই তোমরা আমার অনুসরণ কর এবং আমার আদেশ মেনে চল’।",
        "তারা বলল, ‘আমরা এর উপরই অবিচল থাকব যতক্ষণ না মূসা আমাদের কাছে ফিরে আসে’।",
        "মূসা বলল, ‘হে হারূন! তুমি যখন দেখলে যে, তারা পথভ্রষ্ট হয়ে গেছে তখন তোমাকে কিসে বিরত রাখল’",
        "যে তুমি আমার অনুসরণ করলে না? তাহলে তুমিও কি আমার আদেশ অমান্য করেছ’?",
        "সে বলল, ‘হে আমার সহোদর! আমার দাড়িও ধরো না, মাথার চুলও ধরো না। আমি আশংকা করেছিলাম যে, তুমি বলবে, তুমি বনী ইসরাঈলের মধ্যে বিভেদ সৃষ্টি করেছ এবং আমার কথা রক্ষা করনি’।",
        "মূসা বলল, ‘হে সামেরী! তোমার কী অবস্থা’?",
        "সে বলল, ‘আমি এমন কিছু দেখেছি যা ওরা দেখেনি। তারপর আমি দূতের (জিবরীলের) পায়ের চিহ্ন থেকে এক মুষ্টি মাটি নিয়েছিলাম। অতঃপর তা নিক্ষেপ করেছিলাম। আর আমার মন আমার জন্য এরূপ করাটা শোভন করেছিল’।",
        "মূসা বলল, ‘যাও, তোমার শাস্তি হল, জীবদ্দশায় তুমি বলতে থাকবে, ‘আমি অস্পৃশ্য’। আর তোমার জন্য একটা নির্দিষ্ট সময় রইল যার কখনো ব্যতিক্রম হবে না। আর তুমি তোমার ইলাহের প্রতি চেয়ে দেখ, যার পূজায় তুমি রত ছিলে, আমরা তা অবশ্যই জ্বালিয়ে দেব। তারপর বিক্ষিপ্ত করে তা সাগরে নিক্ষেপ করবই’।",
        "‘তোমাদের ইলাহ তো কেবল আল্লাহই। তিনি ছাড়া তোমাদের কোন ইলাহ নেই। সকল বিষয়েই তার জ্ঞান পরিব্যাপ্ত’।",
        "পূর্বে যা ঘটে গেছে তার কিছু সংবাদ এভাবেই আমি তোমার কাছে বর্ণনা করি। আর আমি তোমাকে আমার পক্ষ থেকে উপদেশ দান করেছি।",
        "তা থেকে যে বিমুখ হবে, অবশ্যই সে কিয়ামতের দিন পাপের বোঝা বহন করবে।",
        "সেখানে তারা স্থায়ী হবে এবং কিয়ামতের দিন এটা তাদের জন্য বোঝা হিসেবে কতই না মন্দ হবে!",
        "যেদিন শিংগায় ফুঁক দেয়া হবে, আর সেদিন আমি অপরাধীদেরকে দৃষ্টিহীন অবস্থায় সমবেত করব।",
        "সেদিন তারা চুপে চুপে নিজদের মধ্যে বলাবলি করবে, ‘তোমরা মাত্র দশদিন অবস্থান করেছিলে’।",
        "আমি ভালভাবেই জানি তারা কী বলবে, তাদের মধ্যে অপেক্ষাকৃত সৎপথে ছিল যে লোকটি সে বলবে, ‘তোমরা মাত্র একদিন অবস্থান করেছিলে’!",
        "আর তারা তোমাকে পাহাড় সম্পর্কে জিজ্ঞাসা করে। বল, ‘আমার রব এগুলোকে সমূলে উৎপাটন করে বিক্ষিপ্ত করে দিবেন’।",
        "‘তারপর তিনি তাকে মসৃণ সমতলভূমি করে দিবেন’।",
        "‘তাতে তুমি কোন বক্রতা ও উচ্চতা দেখবে না’।",
        "সেদিন তারা আহবানকারীর (ফেরেশতার) অনুসরণ করবে। এর কোন এদিক সেদিক হবে না এবং পরম করুণাময়ের সামনে সকল আওয়াজ নিচু হয়ে যাবে। তাই মৃদু আওয়াজ ছাড়া তুমি কিছুই শুনতে পাবে না।",
        "সেদিন পরম করুণাময় যাকে অনুমতি দিবেন আর যার কথায় তিনি সন্তুষ্ট হবেন তার সুপারিশ ছাড়া কারো সুপারিশ কোন কাজে আসবে না।",
        "তিনি তাদের আগের ও পরের সব কিছুই জানেন, কিন্তু তারা জ্ঞান দিয়ে তাঁকে বেষ্টন করতে পারবে না।",
        "আর চিরঞ্জীব, চিরপ্রতিষ্ঠিত সত্তার সামনে সকলেই অবনত হবে। আর সে অবশ্যই ব্যর্থ হবে যে যুলম বহন করবে।",
        "এবং যে মুমিন অবস্থায় ভাল কাজ করবে সে কোন যুলম বা ক্ষতির আশংকা করবে না।",
        "আর এভাবেই আমি আরবী ভাষায় কুরআন নাযিল করেছি এবং তাতে বিভিন্ন সতর্কবাণী বর্ণনা করেছি, যাতে তারা মুত্তাকী হতে পারে অথবা তা হয় তাদের জন্য উপদেশ।",
        "সুতরাং আল্লাহ মহান যিনি সত্যিকার অধিপতি; তোমার প্রতি ওহী সম্পূর্ণ হওয়ার পূর্বে তুমি কুরআন পাঠে তাড়াহুড়া করো না এবং তুমি বল, ‘হে আমার রব, আমার জ্ঞান বৃদ্ধি করে দিন।’",
        "আর আমি ইতিপূর্বে আদমের প্রতি নির্দেশ দিয়েছিলাম; কিন্তু সে তা ভুলে গিয়েছিল এবং আমি তার মধ্যে সংকল্পে দৃঢ়তা পাইনি।",
        "আর স্মরণ কর, যখন আমি ফেরেশতাদেরকে বললাম, ‘তোমরা আদমকে সিজদা কর,’ তখন ইবলীস ছাড়া সকলেই সিজদা করল; সে অমান্য করল।",
        "অতঃপর আমি বললাম, ‘হে আদম, নিশ্চয় এ তোমার ও তোমার স্ত্রীর শত্রু। সুতরাং সে যেন তোমাদের উভয়কে জান্নাত থেকে কিছুতেই বের করে না দেয়, তাহলে তোমরা দুর্ভোগ পোহাবে’।",
        "‘নিশ্চয় তোমার জন্য এ ব্যবস্থা যে, তুমি সেখানে ক্ষুধার্তও হবে না এবং বস্ত্রহীনও হবে না’।",
        "‘আর সেখানে তুমি পিপাসার্তও হবে না এবং রৌদ্রদগ্ধও হবে না’।",
        "অতঃপর শয়তান তাকে কুমন্ত্রণা দিল, বলল, ‘হে আদম, আমি কি তোমাকে বলে দিব অনন্ত জীবনপ্রদ গাছ এবং অক্ষয় রাজত্ব সম্পর্কে?’",
        "অতঃপর তারা উভয়েই সে গাছ থেকে খেল। তখন তাদের উভয়ের সতর তাদের সামনে প্রকাশ হয়ে পড়ল এবং তারা জান্নাতের গাছের পাতা দিয়ে নিজদেরকে আবৃত করতে লাগল এবং আদম তার রবের হুকুম অমান্য করল; ফলে সে বিভ্রান্ত হল।",
        "এরপর তার রব তাকে মনোনীত করলেন, অতঃপর তার তাওবা কবূল করলেন এবং তাকে পথনির্দেশ করলেন।",
        "তিনি বললেন, ‘তোমরা উভয়েই জান্নাত হতে এক সাথে নেমে যাও। তোমরা একে অপরের শত্রু। অতঃপর যখন তোমাদের কাছে আমার পক্ষ থেকে হিদায়াত আসবে, তখন যে আমার হিদায়াতের অনুসরণ করবে সে বিপথগামী হবে না এবং দুর্ভাগাও হবে না’।",
        "‘আর যে আমার স্মরণ থেকে মুখ ফিরিয়ে নেবে, তার জন্য হবে নিশ্চয় এক সংকুচিত জীবন এবং আমি তাকে কিয়ামত দিবসে উঠাবো অন্ধ অবস্থায়।",
        "সে বলবে, ‘হে আমার রব, কেন আপনি আমাকে অন্ধ অবস্থায় উঠালেন? অথচ আমি তো ছিলাম দৃষ্টিশক্তি সম্পন্ন’?",
        "তিনি বলবেন, ‘এমনিভাবেই তোমার নিকট আমার নিদর্শনাবলী এসেছিল, কিন্তু তুমি তা ভুলে গিয়েছিলে এবং সেভাবেই আজ তোমাকে ভুলে যাওয়া হল’।",
        "আর এভাবেই আমি প্রতিফল দান করি তাকে, যে বাড়াবাড়ি করে এবং তার রবের নিদর্শনাবলীতে ঈমান আনে না। আর আখিরাতের আযাব তো অবশ্যই কঠোরতর ও অধিকতর স্থায়ী।",
        "এটি কি তাদেরকে সৎপথ প্রদর্শন করল না যে, আমি তাদের পূর্বে কত মানবগোষ্ঠীকে ধ্বংস করে দিয়েছি, যাদের বাসভূমিতে তারা বিচরণ করে? নিশ্চয় এর মধ্যে রয়েছে বিবেকসম্পন্নদের জন্য নিদর্শন।",
        "আর যদি তোমার রবের পক্ষ থেকে পূর্ব সিদ্ধান্ত ও একটি কাল নির্ধারিত হয়ে না থাকত, তবে আশু শাস্তি অবশ্যম্ভাবী হত।",
        "সুতরাং এরা যা বলে তার উপর ধৈর্য ধারণ কর এবং তাসবীহ পাঠ কর তোমার রবের প্রশংসা বর্ণনার মাধ্যমে, সূর্যোদয়ের পূর্বে, সূর্যাস্তের পূর্বে এবং তাসবীহ পাঠ কর রাতের কিছু অংশে ও দিনের প্রান্তসমূহে, যাতে তুমি সন্তুষ্ট হতে পার।",
        "আর তুমি কখনো প্রসারিত করো না তোমার দু’চোখ সে সবের প্রতি, যা আমি তাদের বিভিন্ন শ্রেণীকে দুনিয়ার জীবনের জাঁক-জমকস্বরূপ উপভোগের উপকরণ হিসেবে দিয়েছি। যাতে আমি সে বিষয়ে তাদেরকে পরীক্ষা করে নিতে পারি। আর তোমার রবের প্রদত্ত রিয্ক সর্বোৎকৃষ্ট ও অধিকতর স্থায়ী।",
        "আর তোমার পরিবার-পরিজনকে সালাত আদায়ের আদেশ দাও এবং নিজেও তার উপর অবিচল থাক। আমি তোমার কাছে কোন রিয্ক চাই না। আমিই তোমাকে রিয্ক দেই আর শুভ পরিণাম তো মুত্তাকীদের জন্য।",
        "আর তারা বলে, ‘সে তার রবের কাছ থেকে আমাদের নিকট কোন নিদর্শন নিয়ে আসে না কেন’? পূর্ববর্তী গ্রন্থসমূহে যে সুস্পষ্ট প্রমাণ রয়েছে তা কি তাদের কাছে আসেনি?",
        "আর যদি আমি তাদেরকে ইতঃপূর্বে কোন আযাব দ্বারা ধ্বংস করতাম তবে অবশ্যই, তারা বলত, ‘হে আমাদের রব, আপনি আমাদের কাছে কোন রাসূল পাঠালেন না কেন? তাহলে তো আমরা লাঞ্ছিত ও অপমানিত হওয়ার পূর্বে আপনার নিদর্শনাবলী অনুসরণ করতাম’।",
        "বল, ‘প্রত্যেকেই প্রতীক্ষা করছে, অতএব তোমরাও প্রতীক্ষায় থাক। শীঘ্রই তোমরা জানতে পারবে কারা সঠিক পথের উপর রয়েছে এবং কারা হিদায়াতপ্রাপ্ত’।"

        "جب تمہاری بہن (فرعون کے ہاں) گئی اور کہنے لگی کہ میں تمہیں ایسا شخص بتاؤں جو اس کو پالے۔ تو (اس طریق سے) ہم نے تم کو تمہاری ماں کے پاس پہنچا دیا تاکہ ان کی آنکھیں ٹھنڈی ہوں اور وہ رنج نہ کریں۔ اور تم نے ایک شخص کو مار ڈالا تو ہم نے تم کو غم سے مخلصی دی اور ہم نے تمہاری (کئی بار) آزمائش کی۔ پھر تم کئی سال اہل مدین میں ٹھہرے رہے۔ پھر اے موسیٰ تم (قابلیت رسالت کے) اندازے پر آ پہنچے",
        "اور میں نے تم کو اپنے (کام کے) لئے بنایا ہے",
        "تو تم اور تمہارا بھائی دونوں ہماری نشانیاں لے کر جاؤ اور میری یاد میں سستی نہ کرنا",
        "دونوں فرعون کے پاس جاؤ وہ سرکش ہو رہا ہے",
        "اور اس سے نرمی سے بات کرنا شاید وہ غور کرے یا ڈر جائے",
        "دونوں کہنے لگے کہ ہمارے پروردگار ہمیں خوف ہے کہ ہم پر تعدی کرنے لگے یا زیادہ سرکش ہوجائے",
        "خدا نے فرمایا کہ ڈرو مت میں تمہارے ساتھ ہوں (اور) سنتا اور دیکھتا ہوں",
        "(اچھا) تو اس کے پاس جاؤ اور کہو کہ ہم آپ کے پروردگار کے بھیجے ہوئے ہیں تو بنی اسرائیل کو ہمارے ساتھ جانے کی اجازت دیجیئے۔ اور انہیں عذاب نہ کیجیئے۔ ہم آپ کے پاس آپ کے پروردگار کی طرف سے نشانی لے کر آئے ہیں۔ اور جو ہدایت کی بات مانے اس کو سلامتی ہو",
        "ہماری طرف یہ وحی آئی ہے کہ جو جھٹلائے اور منہ پھیرے اس کے لئے عذاب (تیار) ہے",
        "(غرض موسیٰ اور ہارون فرعون کے پاس گئے) اس نے کہا کہ موسیٰ تمہارا پروردگار کون ہے؟",
        "کہا کہ ہمارا پروردگار وہ ہے جس نے ہر چیز کو اس کی شکل وصورت بخشی پھر راہ دکھائی",
        "کہا تو پہلی جماعتوں کا کیا حال؟",
        "کہا کہ ان کا علم میرے پروردگار کو ہے (جو) کتاب میں (لکھا ہوا ہے)۔ میرا پروردگار نہ چوکتا ہے نہ بھولتا ہے",
        "وہ (وہی تو ہے) جس نے تم لوگوں کے لئے زمین کو فرش بنایا اور اس میں تمہارے لئے رستے جاری کئے اور آسمان سے پانی برسایا۔ پھر اس سے انواع واقسام کی مختلف روئیدگیاں پیدا کیں",
        "کہ (خود بھی) کھاؤ اور اپنے چارپایوں کو بھی چراؤ۔ بےشک ان (باتوں) میں عقل والوں کے لئے (بہت سی) نشانیاں ہیں",
        "اسی (زمین) سے ہم تم کو پیدا کیا اور اسی میں تمہیں لوٹائیں گے اور اسی سے دوسری دفعہ نکالیں گے",
        "اور ہم نے فرعون کو اپنی سب نشانیاں دکھائیں مگر وہ تکذیب وانکار ہی کرتا رہا",
        "کہنے لگا کہ موسیٰ تم ہمارے پاس اس لئے آئے ہو کہ اپنے جادو (کے زور) سے ہمیں ہمارے ملک سے نکال دو",
        "تو ہم بھی تمہارے مقابل ایسا ہی جادو لائیں گے تو ہمارے اور اپنے درمیان ایک وقت مقرر کر لو کہ نہ تو ہم اس کے خلاف کریں اور نہ تم (اور یہ مقابلہ) ایک ہموار میدان میں (ہوگا)",
        "موسیٰ نے کہا آپ کے لئے (مقابلے کا) دن نو روز (مقرر کیا جاتا ہے) اور یہ کہ لوگ اس دن چاشت کے وقت اکھٹے ہوجائیں",
        "تو فرعون لوٹ گیا اور اپنے سامان جمع کرکے پھر آیا",
        "موسیٰ نے ان (جادوگروں) سے کہا کہ ہائے تمہاری کمبختی۔ خدا پر جھوٹ افتراء نہ کرو کہ وہ تمہیں عذاب سے فنا کردے گا اور جس نے افتراء کیا وہ نامراد رہا",
        "تو وہ باہم اپنے معاملے میں جھگڑانے اور چپکے چپکے سرگوشی کرنے لگے",
        "کہنے لگے یہ دونوں جادوگر ہیں چاہتے ہیں کہ اپنے جادو (کے زور) سے تم کو تمہارے ملک سے نکل دیں اور تمہارے شائستہ مذہب کو نابود کردیں",
        "تو تم (جادو کا) سامان اکھٹا کرلو اور پھر قطار باندھ کر آؤ۔ آج جو غالب رہا وہی کامیاب ہوا",
        "بولے کہ موسیٰ یا تم (اپنی چیز) ڈالو یا ہم (اپنی چیزیں) پہلے ڈالتے ہیں",
        "موسیٰ نے کہا نہیں تم ہی ڈالو۔ (جب انہوں نے چیزیں ڈالیں) تو ناگہاں ان کی رسیاں اور لاٹھیاں موسی کے خیال میں ایسی آنے لگیں کہ وہ (میدان) میں ادھر اُدھر دوڑ رہی ہیں",
        "(اُس وقت) موسیٰ نے اپنے دل میں خوف معلوم کیا",
        "ہم نے کہا خوف نہ کرو بلاشبہ تم ہی غالب ہو",
        "اور جو چیز (یعنی لاٹھی) تمہارے داہنے ہاتھ میں ہے اسے ڈال دو کہ جو کچھ انہوں نے بنایا ہے اس کو نگل جائے گی۔ جو کچھ انہوں نے بنایا ہے (یہ تو) جادوگروں کے ہتھکنڈے ہیں اور جادوگر جہاں جائے فلاح نہیں پائے گا",
        "(القصہ یوں ہی ہوا) تو جادوگر سجدے میں گر پڑے (اور) کہنے لگے کہ ہم موسیٰ اور ہارون کے پروردگار پر ایمان لائے",
        "(فرعون) بولا کہ پیشتر اس کے میں تمہیں اجازت دوں تم اس پر ایمان لے آئے۔ بےشک وہ تمہارا بڑا (یعنی استاد) ہے جس نے تم کو جادو سکھایا ہے۔ سو میں تمہارے ہاتھ اور پاؤں (جانب) خلاف سے کٹوا دوں گا اور کھجور کے تنوں پر سولی چڑھوا دوں گا (اس وقت) تم کو معلوم ہوگا کہ ہم میں سے کس کا عذاب زیادہ سخت اور دیر تک رہنے والا ہے",
        "انہوں نے کہا جو دلائل ہمارے پاس آگئے ہیں ان پر اور جس نے ہم کو پیدا ہے اس پر ہم آپ کو ہرگز ترجیح نہیں دیں گے تو آپ کو جو حکم دینا ہو دے دیجیئے۔ اور آپ (جو) حکم دے سکتے ہیں وہ صرف اسی دنیا کی زندگی میں (دے سکتے ہیں)",
        "ہم اپنے پروردگار پر ایمان لے آئے تاکہ وہ ہمارے گناہوں کو معاف کرے اور (اسے بھی) جو آپ نے ہم سے زبردستی جادو کرایا۔ اور خدا بہتر اور باقی رہنے والا ہے",
        "جو شخص اپنے پروردگار کے پاس گنہگار ہو کر آئے گا تو اس کے لئے جہنم ہے۔ جس میں نہ مرے گا نہ جیئے گا",
        "اور جو اس کے روبرو ایماندار ہو کر آئے گا اور عمل بھی نیک کئے ہوں گے تو ایسے لوگوں کے لئے اونچے اونچے درجے ہیں",
        "(یعنی) ہمیشہ رہنے کے باغ جن کے نیچے نہریں بہہ رہی ہیں۔ ہمیشہ ان میں رہیں گے۔ اور یہ اس شخص کا بدلہ ہے جو پاک ہوا",
        "اور ہم نے موسیٰ کی طرف وحی بھیجی کہ ہمارے بندوں کو راتوں رات نکال لے جاؤ پھر ان کے لئے دریا میں (لاٹھی مار کر) خشک رستہ بنا دو پھر تم کو نہ تو (فرعون کے) آپکڑنے کا خوف ہوگا اور نہ (غرق ہونے کا) ڈر",
        "پھر فرعون نے اپنے لشکر کے ساتھ ان کا تعاقب کیا تو دریا (کی موجوں) نے ان پر چڑھ کر انہیں ڈھانک لیا (یعنی ڈبو دیا)",
        "اور فرعون نے اپنی قوم کو گمراہ کردیا اور سیدھے رستے پر نہ ڈالا",
        "اے آل یعقوب ہم نے تم کو تمہارے دشمن سے نجات دی اور تورات دینے کے لئے تم سے کوہ طور کی داہنی طرف مقرر کی اور تم پر من اور سلویٰ نازل کیا",
        "(اور حکم دیا کہ) جو پاکیزہ چیزیں ہم نے تم کو دی ہیں ان کو کھاؤ۔ اور اس میں حد سے نہ نکلنا۔ ورنہ تم پر میرا غضب نازل ہوگا۔ اور جس پر میرا غضب نازل ہوا وہ ہلاک ہوگیا",
        "اور جو توبہ کرے اور ایمان لائے اور عمل نیک کرے پھر سیدھے رستے چلے اس کو میں بخش دینے والا ہوں",
        "اور اے موسیٰ تم نے اپنی قوم سے (آگے چلے آنے میں) کیوں جلدی کی",
        "کہا وہ میرے پیچھے (آ رہے) ہیں اور اے پروردگار میں نے تیری طرف (آنے کی) جلدی اس لئے کی کہ تو خوش ہو",
        "فرمایا کہ ہم نے تمہاری قوم کو تمہارے بعد آزمائش میں ڈال دیا ہے اور سامری نے ان کو بہکا دیا ہے",
        "اور موسیٰ غصّے اور غم کی حالت میں اپنی قوم کے پاس واپس آئے (اور) کہنے لگے کہ اے قوم کیا تمہارے پروردگار نے تم سے ایک اچھا وعدہ نہیں کیا تھا؟ کیا (میری جدائی کی) مدت تمہیں دراز (معلوم) ہوئی یا تم نے چاہا کہ تم پر تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے غضب نازل ہو۔ اور (اس لئے) تم نے مجھ سے جو وعدہ کیا تھا (اس کے) خلاف کیا",
        "وہ کہنے لگے کہ ہم نے اپنے اختیار سے تم سے وعدہ خلاف نہیں کیا۔ بلکہ ہم لوگوں کے زیوروں کا بوجھ اٹھائے ہوئے تھے۔ پھر ہم نے اس کو (آگ میں) ڈال دیا اور اسی طرح سامری نے ڈال دیا",
        "تو اس نے ان کے لئے ایک بچھڑا بنا دیا (یعنی اس کا) قالب جس کی آواز گائے کی سی تھی۔ تو لوگ کہنے لگے کہ یہی تمہارا معبود ہے اور موسیٰ کا بھی معبود ہے۔ مگر وہ بھول گئے ہیں",
        "کیا یہ لوگ نہیں دیکھتے کہ وہ ان کی کسی بات کا جواب نہیں دیتا۔ اور نہ ان کے نقصان اور نفع کا کچھ اختیار رکھتا ہے",
        "اور ہارون نے ان سے پہلے ہی کہہ دیا تھا کہ لوگو اس سے صرف تمہاری آزمائش کی گئی ہے۔ اور تمہارا پروردگار تو خدا ہے تو میری پیروی کرو اور میرا کہا مانو",
        "وہ کہنے لگے کہ جب تک موسیٰ ہمارے پاس واپس نہ آئیں ہم تو اس کی پوجا پر قائم رہیں گے",
        "(پھر موسیٰ نے ہارون سے) کہا کہ ہارون جب تم نے ان کو دیکھا تھا کہ گمراہ ہو رہے ہیں تو تم کو کس چیز نے روکا",
        "(یعنی) اس بات سے کہ تم میرے پیچھے چلے آؤ۔ بھلا تم نے میرے حکم کے خلاف (کیوں) کیا؟",
        "کہنے لگے کہ بھائی میری ڈاڑھی اور سر (کے بالوں) کو نہ پکڑیئے۔ میں تو اس سے ڈرا کہ آپ یہ نہ کہیں کہ تم نے بنی اسرائیل میں تفرقہ ڈال دیا اور میری بات کو ملحوظ نہ رکھا",
        "پھر (سامری سے) کہنے لگے کہ سامری تیرا کیا حال ہے؟",
        "اس نے کہا کہ میں نے ایسی چیز دیکھی جو اوروں نے نہیں دیکھی تو میں نے فرشتے کے نقش پا سے (مٹی کی) ایک مٹھی بھر لی۔ پھر اس کو (بچھڑے کے قالب میں) ڈال دیا اور مجھے میرے جی نے (اس کام کو) اچھا بتایا",
        "(موسیٰ نے) کہا جا تجھ کو دنیا کی زندگی میں یہ (سزا) ہے کہ کہتا رہے کہ مجھ کو ہاتھ نہ لگانا اور تیرے لئے ایک اور وعدہ ہے (یعنی عذاب کا) جو تجھ سے ٹل نہ سکے گا اور جس معبود (کی پوجا) پر تو (قائم و) معتکف تھا اس کو دیکھ۔ ہم اسے جلادیں گے پھر اس (کی راکھ) کو اُڑا کر دریا میں بکھیر دیں گے",
        "تمہارا معبود خدا ہی ہے جس کے سوا کوئی معبود نہیں۔ اس کا علم ہر چیز پر محیط ہے",
        "اس طرح پر ہم تم سے وہ حالات بیان کرتے ہیں جو گذر چکے ہیں۔ اور ہم نے تمہیں اپنے پاس سے نصیحت (کی کتاب) عطا فرمائی ہے",
        "جو شخص اس سے منہ پھیرے گا وہ قیامت کے دن (گناہ کا) بوجھ اُٹھائے گا",
        "(ایسے لوگ) ہمیشہ اس (عذاب) میں (مبتلا) رہیں گے اور یہ بوجھ قیامت کے روز ان کے لئے برا ہے",
        "جس روز صور پھونکا جائے گا اور ہم گنہگاروں کو اکھٹا کریں گے اور ان کی آنکھیں نیلی نیلی ہوں گی",
        "(تو) وہ آپس میں آہستہ آہستہ کہیں گے کہ تم (دنیا میں) صرف دس ہی دن رہے ہو",
        "جو باتیں یہ کریں گے ہم خوب جانتے ہیں۔ اس وقت ان میں سب سے اچھی راہ والا (یعنی عاقل وہوشمند) کہے گا کہ (نہیں بلکہ) صرف ایک ہی روز ٹھہرے ہو",
        "اور تم سے پہاڑوں کے بارے میں دریافت کرتے ہیں۔ کہہ دو کہ خدا ان کو اُڑا کر بکھیر دے گا",
        "اور زمین کو ہموار میدان کر چھوڑے گا",
        "جس میں نہ تم کجی (اور پستی) دیکھو گے نہ ٹیلا (اور بلندی)",
        "اس روز لوگ ایک پکارنے والے کے پیچھے چلیں گے اور اس کی پیروی سے انحراف نہ کرسکیں گے اور خدا کے سامنے آوازیں پست ہوجائیں گی تو تم آواز خفی کے سوا کوئی آواز نہ سنو گے",
        "اس روز (کسی کی) سفارش کچھ فائدہ نہ دے گی مگر اس شخص کی جسے خدا اجازت دے اور اس کی بات کو پسند فرمائے",
        "جو کچھ ان کے آگے ہے اور کچھ ان کے پیچھے ہے وہ اس کو جانتا ہے اور وہ (اپنے) علم سے خدا (کے علم) پر احاطہ نہیں کرسکتے",
        "اور اس زندہ و قائم کے رو برو منہ نیچے ہوجائیں گے۔ اور جس نے ظلم کا بوجھ اٹھایا وہ نامراد رہا",
        "اور جو نیک کام کرے گا اور مومن بھی ہوگا تو اس کو نہ ظلم کا خوف ہوگا اور نہ نقصان کا",
        "اور ہم نے اس کو اسی طرح کا قرآن عربی نازل کیا ہے اور اس میں طرح طرح کے ڈراوے بیان کردیئے ہیں تاکہ لوگ پرہیزگار بنیں یا خدا ان کے لئے نصیحت پیدا کردے",
        "تو خدا جو سچا بادشاہ ہے عالی قدر ہے۔ اور قرآن کی وحی جو تمہاری طرف بھیجی جاتی ہے اس کے پورا ہونے سے پہلے قرآن کے (پڑھنے کے) لئے جلدی نہ کیا کرو اور دعا کرو کہ میرے پروردگار مجھے اور زیادہ علم دے",
        "اور ہم نے پہلے آدم سے عہد لیا تھا مگر وہ (اسے) بھول گئے اور ہم نے ان میں صبر وثبات نہ دیکھا",
        "اور جب ہم نے فرشتوں سے کہا کہ آدم کے آگے سجدہ کرو تو سب سجدے میں گر پڑے مگر ابلیس نے انکار کیا",
        "ہم نے فرمایا کہ آدم یہ تمہارا اور تمہاری بیوی کا دشمن ہے تو یہ کہیں تم دونوں کو بہشت سے نکلوا نہ دے۔ پھر تم تکلیف میں پڑجاؤ",
        "یہاں تم کو یہ (آسائش) ہوگی کہ نہ بھوکے رہو نہ ننگے",
        "اور یہ کہ نہ پیاسے رہو اور نہ دھوپ کھاؤ",
        "تو شیطان نے ان کے دل میں وسوسہ ڈالا۔ (اور) کہا کہ آدم بھلا میں تم کو (ایسا) درخت بتاؤں (جو) ہمیشہ کی زندگی کا (ثمرہ دے) اور (ایسی) بادشاہت کہ کبھی زائل نہ ہو",
        "تو دونوں نے اس درخت کا پھل کھا لیا تو ان پر ان کی شرمگاہیں ظاہر ہوگئیں اور وہ اپنے (بدنوں) پر بہشت کے پتّے چپکانے لگے۔ اور آدم نے اپنے پروردگار کے حکم خلاف کیا تو (وہ اپنے مطلوب سے) بےراہ ہو گئے",
        "پھر ان کے پروردگار نے ان کو نوازا تو ان پر مہربانی سے توجہ فرمائی اور سیدھی راہ بتائی",
        "فرمایا کہ تم دونوں یہاں سے نیچے اتر جاؤ۔ تم میں بعض بعض کے دشمن (ہوں گے) پھر اگر میری طرف سے تمہارے پاس ہدایت آئے تو جو شخص میری ہدایت کی پیروی کرے گا وہ نہ گمراہ ہوگا اور نہ تکلیف میں پڑے گا",
        "اور جو میری نصیحت سے منہ پھیرے گا اس کی زندگی تنگ ہوجائے گی اور قیامت کو ہم اسے اندھا کرکے اٹھائیں گے",
        "وہ کہے گا میرے پروردگار تو نے مجھے اندھا کرکے کیوں اٹھایا میں تو دیکھتا بھالتا تھا",
        "خدا فرمائے گا کہ ایسا ہی (چاہیئے تھا) تیرے پاس میری آیتیں آئیں تو تونے ان کو بھلا دیا۔ اسی طرح آج ہم تجھ کو بھلا دیں گے",
        "اور جو شخص حد سے نکل جائے اور اپنے پروردگار کی آیتوں پر ایمان نہ لائے ہم اس کو ایسا ہی بدلہ دیتے ہیں۔ اور آخرت کا عذاب بہت سخت اور بہت دیر رہنے والا ہے",
        "کیا یہ بات ان لوگوں کے لئے موجب ہدایت نہ ہوئی کہ ہم ان سے پہلے بہت سے لوگوں کو ہلاک کرچکے ہیں جن کے رہنے کے مقامات میں یہ چلتے پھرتے ہیں۔ عقل والوں کے لئے اس میں (بہت سی) نشانیاں ہیں",
        "اور اگر ایک بات تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے پہلے صادر اور (جزائے اعمال کے لئے) ایک میعاد مقرر نہ ہوچکی ہوتی تو (نزول) عذاب لازم ہوجاتا",
        "پس جو کچھ یہ بکواس کرتے ہیں اس پر صبر کرو۔ اور سورج کے نکلنے سے پہلے اور اس کے غروب ہونے سے پہلے اپنے پروردگار کی تسبیح وتحمید کیا کرو۔ اور رات کی ساعات (اولین) میں بھی اس کی تسبیح کیا کرو اور دن کی اطراف (یعنی دوپہر کے قریب ظہر کے وقت بھی) تاکہ تم خوش ہوجاؤ",
        "اور کئی طرح کے لوگوں کو جو ہم نے دنیا کی زندگی میں آرائش کی چیزوں سے بہرہ مند کیا ہے تاکہ ان کی آزمائش کریں ان پر نگاہ نہ کرنا۔ اور تمہاری پروردگار کی (عطا فرمائی ہوئی) روزی بہت بہتر اور باقی رہنے والی ہے",
        "اور اپنے گھر والوں کو نماز کا حکم کرو اور اس پر قائم رہو۔ ہم تم سے روزی کے خواستگار نہیں۔ بلکہ تمہیں ہم روزی دیتے ہیں اور (نیک) انجام (اہل) تقویٰ کا ہے",
        "اور کہتے ہیں کہ یہ (پیغمبر) اپنے پروردگار کی طرف سے ہمارے پاس کوئی نشانی کیوں نہیں لاتے۔ کیا ان کے پاس پہلی کتابوں کی نشانی نہیں آئی؟",
        "اور اگر ہم ان کو پیغمبر (کے بھیجنے) سے پیشتر کسی عذاب سے ہلاک کردیتے تو وہ کہتے کہ اے ہمارے پروردگار تو نے ہماری طرف کوئی پیغمبر کیوں نہ بھیجا کہ ہم ذلیل اور رسوا ہونے سے پہلے تیرے کلام (واحکام) کی پیروی کرتے",
        "کہہ دو کہ سب (نتائج اعمال) کے منتظر ہیں سو تم بھی منتظر رہو۔ عنقریب تم کو معلوم ہوجائے گا کہ (دین کے) سیدھے رستے پر چلنے والے کون ہیں اور (جنت کی طرف) راہ پانے والے کون ہیں (ہم یا تم)"
