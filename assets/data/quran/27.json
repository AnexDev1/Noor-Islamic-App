        "Ṭâ-Sĩn. These are the verses of the Quran; the clear Book.",
        "˹It is˺ a guide and good news for the believers:",
        "˹those˺ who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and have sure faith in the Hereafter.",
        "As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have certainly made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, so they wander blindly.",
        "It is they who will suffer a dreadful torment, and in the Hereafter they will ˹truly˺ be the greatest losers.",
        "And indeed, you ˹O Prophet˺ are receiving the Quran from the One ˹Who is˺ All-Wise, All-Knowing.",
        "˹Remember˺ when Moses said to his family, “I have spotted a fire. I will either bring you some directions from there, or a burning torch so you may warm yourselves.”",
        "But when he came to it, he was called ˹by Allah˺, “Blessed is the one at the fire, and whoever is around it! Glory be to Allah, the Lord of all worlds.",
        "O  Moses! It is truly I. I am Allah—the Almighty, All-Wise.",
        "Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. ˹Allah reassured him,˺ “O Moses! Do not be afraid! Messengers should have no fear in My presence.",
        "˹Fear is˺ only for those who do wrong. But if they later mend ˹their˺ evil ˹ways˺ with good, then I am certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "Now put your hand through ˹the opening of˺ your collar, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished. ˹These are two˺ of nine signs for Pharaoh and his people. They have truly been a rebellious people.”",
        "But when Our enlightening signs came to them, they said, “This is pure magic.”",
        "And, although their hearts were convinced the signs were true, they still denied them wrongfully and arrogantly. See then what was the end of the corruptors!",
        "Indeed, We granted knowledge to David and Solomon. And they said ˹in acknowledgment˺, “All praise is for Allah Who has privileged us over many of His faithful servants.”",
        "And David was succeeded by Solomon, who said, “O people! We have been taught the language of birds, and been given everything ˹we need˺. This is indeed a great privilege.”",
        "Solomon’s forces of jinn, humans, and birds were rallied for him, perfectly organized.",
        "And when they came across a valley of ants, an ant warned, “O ants! Go quickly into your homes so Solomon and his armies do not crush you, unknowingly.”",
        "So Solomon smiled in amusement at her words, and prayed, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your favours which You have blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please you. Admit me, by Your mercy, into ˹the company of˺ Your righteous servants.”",
        "˹One day˺ he inspected the birds, and wondered, “Why is it that I cannot see the hoopoe? Or could he be absent?",
        "I will surely subject him to a severe punishment, or ˹even˺ slaughter him, unless he brings me a compelling excuse.”",
        "It was not long before the bird came and said, “I have found out something you do not know. I have just come to you from Sheba with sure news.",
        "Indeed, I found a woman ruling over them, who has been given everything ˹she needs˺, and who has a magnificent throne.",
        "I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah. For Satan has made their deeds appealing to them—hindering them from the ˹Right˺ Way and leaving them unguided—",
        "so they do not prostrate to Allah, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you ˹all˺ conceal and what you reveal.",
        "˹He is˺ Allah! There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”",
        "Solomon said, “We will see whether you are telling the truth or lying.",
        "Go with this letter of mine and deliver it to them, then stand aside and see how they will respond.”",
        "The Queen ˹later˺ announced, “O chiefs! Indeed, a noble letter has been delivered to me.",
        "It is from Solomon, and it reads: ‘In the Name of Allah—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.",
        "Do not be arrogant with me, but come to me, fully submitting ˹to Allah˺.’”",
        "She said, “O chiefs! Advise me in this matter of mine, for I would never make any decision without you.”",
        "They responded, “We are a people of strength and great ˹military˺ might, but the decision is yours, so decide what you will command.”",
        "She reasoned, “Indeed, when kings invade a land, they ruin it and debase its nobles. They really do so!",
        "But I will certainly send him a gift, and see what ˹response˺ my envoys will return with.”",
        "When the chief-envoy came to him, Solomon said, “Do you offer me wealth? What Allah has granted me is far greater than what He has granted you. No! It is you who rejoice in ˹receiving˺ gifts.",
        "Go back to them, for we will certainly mobilize against them forces which they can never resist, and we will drive them out from there in disgrace, fully humbled.”",
        "Solomon asked, “O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in ˹full˺ submission?”",
        "One mighty jinn responded, “I can bring it to you before you rise from this council of yours. And I am quite strong and trustworthy for this ˹task˺.”",
        "But the one who had knowledge of the Scripture said, “I can bring it to you in the blink of an eye.” So when Solomon saw it placed before him, he exclaimed, “This is by the grace of my Lord to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful, it is only for their own good. But whoever is ungrateful, surely my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Most Generous.”",
        "˹Then˺ Solomon said, “Disguise her throne for her so we may see whether she will recognize ˹it˺ or she will not be able to.”",
        "So when she arrived, it was said ˹to her˺, “Is your throne like this?” She replied, “It looks to be the same. We have ˹already˺ received knowledge ˹of Solomon’s prophethood˺ before this ˹miracle˺, and have submitted ˹to Allah˺.”",
        "But she had been hindered by what she used to worship instead of Allah, for she was indeed from a disbelieving people.",
        "Then she was told, “Enter the palace.” But when she saw the hall, she thought it was a body of water, so she bared her legs. Solomon said. “It is just a palace paved with crystal.” ˹At last˺ she declared, “My Lord! I have certainly wronged my soul. Now I ˹fully˺ submit myself along with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of all worlds.”",
        "And We certainly sent to the people of Thamûd their brother Ṣâliḥ, proclaiming, “Worship Allah,” but they suddenly split into two opposing groups.",
        "He urged ˹the disbelieving group˺, “O my people! Why do you ˹seek to˺ hasten the torment rather than grace? If only you sought Allah’s forgiveness so you may be shown mercy!”",
        "They replied, “You and your followers are a bad omen for us.” He responded, “Your omens are destined by Allah. In fact, you are ˹only˺ a people being tested.”",
        "And there were in the city nine ˹elite˺ men who spread corruption in the land, never doing what is right.",
        "They vowed, “Let us swear by Allah that we will take him and his family down by night. Then we will certainly say to his ˹closest˺ heirs, ‘We did not witness the murder of his family. We are definitely telling the truth.’”",
        "And ˹so˺ they made a plan, but We too made a plan, while they were unaware.",
        "See then what the consequences of their plan were: We ˹utterly˺ destroyed them and their people all together.",
        "So their homes are there, ˹but completely˺ ruined because of their wrongdoing. Surely in this is a lesson for people of knowledge.",
        "And We delivered those who were faithful and were mindful ˹of Allah˺.",
        "And ˹remember˺ Lot, when he rebuked ˹the men of˺ his people, “Do you commit that shameful deed while you can see ˹one another˺?",
        "Do you really lust after men instead of women? In fact, you are ˹only˺ a people acting ignorantly.”",
        "But his people’s only response was to say, “Expel Lot’s followers from your land! They are a people who wish to remain chaste!”",
        "So We delivered him and his family, except his wife. We had destined her to be one of the doomed.",
        "And We poured upon them a rain ˹of brimstone˺. How evil was the rain of those who had been warned!",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Praise be to Allah, and peace be upon the servants He has chosen.” ˹Ask the disbelievers,˺ “Which is better: Allah or whatever ˹gods˺ they associate ˹with Him˺?”",
        "Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down rain for you from the sky, by which We cause delightful gardens to grow? You could never cause their trees to grow. Was it another god besides Allah?” Absolutely not! But they are a people who set up equals ˹to Allah˺!",
        "Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who made the earth a place of settlement, caused rivers to flow through it, placed firm mountains upon it, and set a barrier between ˹fresh and salt˺ bodies of water? Was it another god besides Allah?” Absolutely not! But most of them do not know.",
        "Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who responds to the distressed when they cry to Him, relieving ˹their˺ affliction, and ˹Who˺ makes you successors in the earth? Is it another god besides Allah? Yet you are hardly mindful!”",
        "Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea, and sends the winds ushering in His mercy? Is it another god besides Allah? Exalted is Allah above what they associate ˹with Him˺!",
        "Or ˹ask them,˺ “Who originates the creation then resurrects it, and gives you provisions from the heavens and the earth? Is it another god besides Allah?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof, if what you say is true.”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “None in the heavens and the earth has knowledge of the unseen except Allah. Nor do they know when they will be resurrected.",
        "No! Their knowledge of the Hereafter amounts to ignorance. In fact, they are in doubt about it. In truth, they are ˹totally˺ blind to it.",
        "The disbelievers ask, “When we and our fathers are reduced to dust, will we really be brought forth ˹alive˺?",
        "We have already been promised this, as well as our forefathers earlier. This is nothing but ancient fables!”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Travel throughout the land and see the fate of the wicked.”",
        "Do not grieve for them, nor be distressed by their schemes.",
        "They ask ˹the believers˺, “When will this threat come to pass, if what you say is true?”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Perhaps some of what you seek to hasten is close at hand.”",
        "Surely your Lord is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most of them are ungrateful.",
        "And surely your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal.",
        "For there is nothing hidden in the heavens or the earth without being ˹written˺ in a perfect Record.",
        "Indeed, this Quran clarifies for the Children of Israel most of what they differ over.",
        "And it is truly a guide and mercy for the believers.",
        "Your Lord will certainly judge between them by His justice, for He is the Almighty, All-Knowing.",
        "So put your trust in Allah, for you are surely upon the ˹Path of˺ clear truth.",
        "You certainly cannot make the dead hear ˹the truth˺. Nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and walk away.",
        "Nor can you lead the blind out of their misguidance. You can make none hear ˹the truth˺ except those who believe in Our revelations, ˹fully˺ submitting ˹to Allah˺.",
        "And when the decree ˹of the Hour˺ comes to pass against them, We will bring forth for them a beast from the earth, telling them that the people had no sure faith in Our revelations.",
        "˹Watch for˺ the Day We will gather from every faith-community a group of those who denied Our revelations, and they will be driven in ranks.",
        "When they ˹finally˺ come before their Lord, He will ask ˹them˺, “Did you deny My revelations without ˹even˺ comprehending them? Or what ˹exactly˺ did you do?”",
        "And the decree ˹of torment˺ will be justified against them for their wrongdoing, leaving them speechless.",
        "Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest in and the day bright? Surely in this are signs for those who believe.",
        "And ˹beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and all those in the heavens and all those on the earth will be horrified ˹to the point of death˺, except those Allah wills ˹to spare˺. And all will come before Him, fully humbled.",
        "Now you see the mountains, thinking they are firmly fixed, but they are travelling ˹just˺ like clouds. ˹That is˺ the design of Allah, Who has perfected everything. Surely He is All-Aware of what you do.",
        "Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with what is better, and they will be secure from the horror on that Day.",
        "And whoever comes with an evil deed will be hurled face-first into the Fire. Are you rewarded except for what you used to do?",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city ˹of Mecca˺, Who has made it sacred, and to Him belongs everything. And I am commanded to be one of those who ˹fully˺ submit ˹to Him˺",
        "and to recite the Quran.” Then whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. But whoever chooses to stray, say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I am only a warner.”",
        "And say, “All praise is for Allah! He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them. And your Lord is never unaware of what you do.”"

        "আর সেই শহরে ছিল নয় নেতৃস্থানীয় ব্যক্তি। যারা যমীনে ফাসাদ সৃষ্টি করত এবং সংস্কার-সংশোধনমূলক কিছু করত না।",
        "তারা বলল, ‘তোমরা পরস্পর আল্লাহর কসম কর যে, আমরা রাত্রিকালে তার ও তার পরিবারের উপর অবশ্যই আক্রমণ করব, অতঃপর আমরা তার নিকটাত্মীয়দের বলব, আমরা তার পরিবারবর্গের হত্যাকান্ড প্রত্যক্ষ করিনি। আর নিশ্চয়ই আমরা সত্যবাদী’।",
        "আর তারা এক চক্রান্ত করল এবং আমিও কৌশল অবলম্বন করলাম। অথচ তারা উপলদ্ধিও করতে পারল না।",
        "অতএব দেখ, তাদের চক্রান্তের পরিণাম কিরূপ হয়েছে। আমি তাদের ও তাদের কওমকে একত্রে ধ্বংস করে দিয়েছি।",
        "সুতরাং ঐগুলো তাদের বাড়ীঘর, যা তাদের যুলমের কারণে বিরান হয়ে আছে। নিশ্চয় এর মধ্যে নিদর্শন রয়েছে সে কওমের জন্য যারা জ্ঞান রাখে।",
        "আর আমি মুমিনদের মুক্তি দিলাম এবং তারা ছিল তাকওয়া অবলম্বনকারী।",
        "আর স্মরণ কর লূতের কথা, যখন সে তার কওমকে বলেছিল, ‘তোমরা কেন অশ্লীল কাজ করছ, অথচ তা তোমরা ভালভাবে প্রত্যক্ষ করছ’?",
        "‘তোমরা কি নারীদের বাদ দিয়ে পুরুষদের উপর কামতৃপ্তির জন্য উপগত হবে? বরং তোমরা এমন এক কওম যারা জানে না’।",
        "ফলে তার কওমের জবাব একমাত্র এই ছিল যে, ‘লূতের পরিবারকে তোমাদের জনপদ থেকে বের করে দাও। নিশ্চয় এরা এমন লোক যারা পবিত্র থাকতে চায়’।",
        "অতএব আমি মুক্তি দিলাম তাকে ও তার পরিবারকে, তবে তার স্ত্রীকে ছাড়া। আমি তাকে ধ্বংসপ্রাপ্তদের মধ্যে সাব্যস্ত করে রেখেছিলাম।",
        "আমি তাদের উপর মুষলধারে (পাথরের) বৃষ্টি বর্ষণ করেছিলাম। ভীতি প্রদর্শিতদের জন্য কতইনা নিকৃষ্ট ছিল এই বৃষ্টি!",
        "বল, ‘সকল প্রশংসাই আল্লাহর নিমিত্তে। আর শান্তি তাঁর বান্দাদের প্রতি যাদের তিনি মনোনীত করেছেন। আল্লাহ শ্রেষ্ঠ, না কি যাদের এরা শরীক করে তারা’?",

        "বরং তিনি, যিনি তোমাদেরকে স্থলে ও সমুদ্রের অন্ধকারে পথ দেখান এবং যিনি স্বীয় রহমতের প্রাক্কালে সুসংবাদবাহী বাতাস প্রেরণ করেন। আল্লাহর সাথে কি অন্য কোন ইলাহ আছে? তারা যা কিছু শরীক করে আল্লাহ তা থেকে ঊর্ধ্বে।",
        "বরং তিনি, যিনি সৃষ্টির সূচনা করেন, তারপর তার পুনরাবৃত্তি করবেন এবং যিনি তোমাদেরকে আসমান ও যমীন থেকে রিযিক দান করেন, আল্লাহর সাথে কি কোন ইলাহ আছে? বল, ‘তোমাদের প্রমাণ নিয়ে এসো যদি তোমরা সত্যবাদী হও।’",
        "বল, ‘আল্লাহ ছাড়া আসমানসমূহে ও যমীনে যারা আছে তারা গায়েব জানে না। আর কখন তাদেরকে পুনরুত্থিত করা হবে তা তারা অনুভব করতে পারে না’।",
        "বরং আখিরাত সম্পর্কে তাদের জ্ঞান নিঃশেষ হয়েছে। বরং সে বিষয়ে তারা সন্দেহে আছে; বরং এ ব্যাপারে তারা অন্ধ।",

        "আর যখন তাদের উপর ‘বাণী’ (আযাব) বাস্তবায়িত হবে তখন আমি যমীনের জন্তু (দাব্বাতুল আরদ)* বের করব, যে তাদের সাথে কথা বলবে। কারণ মানুষ আমার আয়াতসমূহে সুদৃঢ় বিশ্বাস রাখত না। \n* কিয়ামতের অন্যতম নিদর্শন হল ‘দাববাতুল আরদ’ বের হওয়া। ইমাম আহমদ (র.) বর্ণনা করেছেন যে, রাসূলুল্লাহ সাল্লাল্লাহু আলাইহি ওয়াসাল্লাম বলেছেন, দশটি নিদর্শন না দেখা পর্যন্ত কিয়ামত হবে না তন্মধ্যে অন্যতম হল, দাববাতুল আরদ বের হওয়া। ইবন কাছীর বলেন, শেষ যামানায় যখন মানুষ সৎকাজের আদেশ দেবে না, অসৎ কাজ হতে নিষেধ করবে না, সত্য দীন পরিবর্তন করবে এবং চারদিকে ফিতনা-ফাসাদ ছড়িয়ে পড়বে তখন ‘দাব্বাতুল আরদ’ বের হবে।",
        "আর স্মরণ কর সেদিনের কথা, যেদিন প্রত্যেক জাতির মধ্য থেকে যারা আমার আয়াতসমূহকে অস্বীকার করত তাদেরকে আমি দলে দলে সমবেত করব। অতঃপর তাদেরকে হাঁকিয়ে নিয়ে যাওয়া হবে।",
        "অবশেষে যখন তারা আসবে, তখন আল্লাহ বলবেন, ‘তোমরা কি আমার আয়াতসমূহকে অস্বীকার করেছিলে, অথচ সে বিষয়ে তোমাদের কোন জ্ঞানই ছিল না? নাকি তোমরা আরো কী করেছিলে?’",

        "اور بےانصافی اور غرور سے ان سے انکار کیا لیکن ان کے دل ان کو مان چکے تھے۔ سو دیکھ لو فساد کرنے والوں کا انجام کیسا ہوا",
        "اور ہم نے داؤد اور سلیمان کو علم بخشا اور انہوں نے کہا کہ خدا کا شکر ہے جس نے ہمیں بہت سے مومن بندوں پر فضلیت دی",
        "اور سلیمان اور داؤد کے قائم مقام ہوئے۔ اور کہنے لگے کہ لوگو! ہمیں (خدا کی طرف سے) جانوروں کی بولی سکھائی گئی ہے اور ہر چیز عنایت فرمائی گئی ہے۔ بےشک یہ (اُس کا) صریح فضل ہے",

        "(اور نہیں سمجھتے) کہ خدا کو آسمانوں اور زمین میں چھپی چیزوں کو ظاہر کردیتا اور تمہارے پوشیدہ اور ظاہر اعمال کو جانتا ہے کیوں سجدہ نہ کریں",

        "ایک شخص جس کو کتاب الہیٰ کا علم تھا کہنے لگا کہ میں آپ کی آنکھ کے جھپکنے سے پہلے پہلے اسے آپ کے پاس حاضر کئے دیتا ہوں۔ جب سلیمان نے تخت کو اپنے پاس رکھا ہوا دیکھا تو کہا کہ یہ میرے پروردگار کا فضل ہے تاکہ مجھے آزمائے کہ میں شکر کرتا ہوں یا کفران نعمت کرتا ہوں اور جو شکر کرتا ہے تو اپنے ہی فائدے کے لئے شکر کرتا ہے اور جو ناشکری کرتا ہے تو میرا پروردگار بےپروا (اور) کرم کرنے والا ہے",

        "جب وہ آ پہنچی تو پوچھا گیا کہ کیا آپ کا تخت بھی اسی طرح کا ہے؟ اس نے کہا کہ یہ تو گویا ہو بہو وہی ہے اور ہم کو اس سے پہلے ہی (سلیمان کی عظمت شان) کا علم ہوگیا تھا اور ہم فرمانبردار ہیں",
        "اور وہ جو خدا کے سوا (اور کی) پرستش کرتی تھی، سلیمان نے اس کو اس سے منع کیا (اس سے پہلے تو) وہ کافروں میں سے تھی",
        "(پھر) اس سے کہا گیا کہ محل میں چلیے، جب اس نے اس (کے فرش) کو دیکھا تو اسے پانی کا حوض سمجھا اور (کپڑا اٹھا کر) اپنی پنڈلیاں کھول دیں۔ سلیمان نے کہا یہ ایسا محل ہے جس میں (نیچے بھی) شیشے جڑے ہوئے ہیں۔ وہ بول اٹھی کہ پروردگار میں اپنے آپ پر ظلم کرتی رہی تھی اور (اب) میں سلیمان کے ہاتھ پر خدائے رب العالمین پر ایمان لاتی ہوں",

        "وہ کہنے لگے کہ تم اور تمہارے ساتھی ہمارے لئے شگون بد ہے۔ صالح نے کہا کہ تمہاری بدشگونی خدا کی طرف سے ہے بلکہ تم ایسے لوگ ہو جن کی آزمائش کی جاتی ہے",
        "اور شہر میں نو شخص تھے جو ملک میں فساد کیا کرتے تھے اور اصلاح سے کام نہیں لیتے تھے",
        "کہنے لگے کہ خدا کی قسم کھاؤ کہ ہم رات کو اس پر اور اس کے گھر والوں پر شب خون ماریں گے پھر اس کے وارث سے کہہ دیں گے کہ ہم تو صالح کے گھر والوں کے موقع ہلاکت پر گئے ہی نہیں اور ہم سچ کہتے ہیں",
        "اور وہ ایک چال چلے اور ان کو کچھ خبر نہ ہوئی",
        "تو دیکھ لو ان کی چال کا کیسا انجام ہوا۔ ہم نے ان کو اور ان کی قوم سب کو ہلاک کر ڈالا",
        "اب یہ ان کے گھر ان کے ظلم کے سبب خالی پڑے ہیں۔ جو لوگ دانش رکھتے ہیں، ان کے لئے اس میں نشانی ہے",
        "اور جو لوگ ایمان لائے اور ڈرتے تھے ان کو ہم نے نجات دی",
        "اور لوط کو (یاد کرو) جب انہوں نے اپنی قوم سے کہا کہ تم بےحیائی (کے کام) کیوں کرتے ہو اور تم دیکھتے ہو",
        "کیا تم عورتوں کو چھوڑ کر (لذت حاصل کرنے) کے لئے مردوں کی طرف مائل ہوتے ہو۔ حقیقت یہ ہے کہ تم احمق لوگ ہو",
        "تو ان کی قوم کے لوگ (بولے تو) یہ بولے اور اس کے سوا ان کا کچھ جواب نہ تھا کہ لوط کے گھر والوں کو اپنے شہر سے نکال دو۔ یہ لوگ پاک رہنا چاہتے ہیں",
        "تو ہم نے ان کو اور ان کے گھر والوں کو نجات دی۔ مگر ان کی بیوی کہ اس کی نسبت ہم نے مقرر کر رکھا ہے (کہ وہ پیچھے رہنے والوں میں ہوگی)",
        "اور ہم نے ان پر مینھہ برسایا سو (جو) مینھہ ان لوگوں پر برسا جن کو متنبہ کردیا گیا تھا، برا تھا",
        "کہہ دو کہ سب تعریف خدا ہی کو سزاوار ہے اور اس کے بندوں پر سلام ہے جن کو اس نے منتخب فرمایا۔ بھلا خدا بہتر ہے یا وہ جن کو یہ (اس کا شریک) ٹھہراتے ہیں",
        "بھلا کس نے آسمانوں اور زمین کو پیدا کیا اور (کس نے) تمہارے لئے آسمان سے پانی برسایا۔ (ہم نے) پھر ہم ہی نے اس سے سرسبز باغ اُگائے۔ تمہارا کام تو نہ تھا کہ تم اُن کے درختوں کو اگاتے۔ تو کیا خدا کے ساتھ کوئی اور بھی معبود ہے؟ (ہرگز نہیں) بلکہ یہ لوگ رستے سے الگ ہو رہے ہیں",
        "بھلا کس نے زمین کو قرار گاہ بنایا اور اس کے بیچ نہریں بنائیں اور اس کے لئے پہاڑ بنائے اور (کس نے) دو دریاؤں کے بیچ اوٹ بنائی (یہ سب کچھ خدا نے بنایا) تو کیا خدا کے ساتھ کوئی اور معبود بھی ہے؟ (ہرگز نہیں) بلکہ ان میں اکثر دانش نہیں رکھتے",
        "بھلا کون بیقرار کی التجا قبول کرتا ہے۔ جب وہ اس سے دعا کرتا ہے اور (کون اس کی) تکلیف کو دور کرتا ہے اور (کون) تم کو زمین میں (اگلوں کا) جانشین بناتا ہے (یہ سب کچھ خدا کرتا ہے) تو کیا خدا کے ساتھ کوئی اور معبود بھی ہے (ہرگز نہیں مگر) تم بہت کم غور کرتے ہو",
        "بھلا کون تم کو جنگل اور دریا کے اندھیروں میں رستہ بناتا ہے اور (کون) ہواؤں کو اپنی رحمت کے آگے خوشخبری بناکر بھیجتا ہے (یہ سب کچھ خدا کرتا ہے) تو کیا خدا کے ساتھ کوئی اور معبود بھی ہے؟ (ہرگز نہیں)۔ یہ لوگ جو شرک کرتے ہیں خدا (کی شان) اس سے بلند ہے",
        "بھلا کون خلقت کو پہلی بار پیدا کرتا۔ پھر اس کو بار بار پیدا کرتا رہتا ہے اور (کون) تم کو آسمان اور زمین سے رزق دیتا ہے (یہ سب کچھ خدا کرتا ہے) تو کیا خدا کے ساتھ کوئی اور معبود بھی ہے (ہرگز نہیں) کہہ دو کہ (مشرکو) اگر تم سچے ہو تو دلیل پیش کرو",
        "کہہ دو کہ جو لوگ آسمانوں اور زمین میں ہیں خدا کے سوا غیب کی باتیں نہیں جانتے۔ اور نہ یہ جانتے ہیں کہ کب (زندہ کرکے) اٹھائے جائیں گے",
        "بلکہ آخرت (کے بارے) میں ان کا علم منتہی ہوچکا ہے بلکہ وہ اس سے شک میں ہیں۔ بلکہ اس سے اندھے ہو رہے ہیں",
        "اور جو لوگ کافر ہیں کہتے ہیں جب ہم اور ہمارے باپ دادا مٹی ہو جائیں گے تو کیا ہم پھر (قبروں سے) نکالے جائیں گے",
        "یہ وعدہ ہم سے اور ہمارے باپ دادا سے پہلے سے ہوتا چلا آیا ہے (کہاں کا اُٹھنا اور کیسی قیامت) یہ تو صرف پہلے لوگوں کی کہانیاں ہیں",
        "کہہ دو کہ ملک میں چلو پھرو پھر دیکھو کہ گنہگاروں کا انجام کیا ہوا ہے",
        "اور ان (کے حال) پر غم نہ کرنا اور نہ اُن چالوں سے جو یہ کر رہے ہیں تنگ دل ہونا",
        "اور کہتے ہیں کہ اگر تم سچے ہو تو یہ وعدہ کب پورا ہوگا؟",
        "کہہ دو کہ جس (عذاب) کے لئے تم جلدی کر رہے ہو شاید اس میں سے کچھ تمہارے نزدیک آپہنچا ہو",
        "اور تمہارا پروردگار تو لوگوں پر فضل کرنے والا ہے لیکن ان میں سے اکثر شکر نہیں کرتے",
        "اور جو باتیں ان کے سینوں میں پوشیدہ ہوتی ہیں اور جو کام وہ ظاہر کرتے ہیں تمہارا پروردگار ان (سب) کو جانتا ہے",
        "اور آسمانوں اور زمین میں کوئی پوشیدہ چیز نہیں ہے مگر (وہ) کتاب روشن میں (لکھی ہوئی) ہے",
        "بےشک یہ قرآن بنی اسرائیل کے سامنے اکثر باتیں جن میں وہ اختلاف کرتے ہیں، بیان کر دیتا ہے",
        "اور بےشک یہ مومنوں کے لئے ہدایات اور رحمت ہے",
        "تمہارا پروردگار (قیامت کے روز) اُن میں اپنے حکم سے فیصلہ کر دے گا اور وہ غالب (اور) علم والا ہے",
        "تو خدا پر بھروسہ رکھو تم تو حق صریح پر ہو",
        "کچھ شک نہیں کہ تم مردوں کو (بات) نہیں سنا سکتے اور نہ بہروں کو جب کہ وہ پیٹھ پھیر کر پھر جائیں آواز سنا سکتے ہو",
        "اور نہ اندھوں کو گمراہی سے (نکال کر) رستہ دیکھا سکتے ہو۔ تم ان ہی کو سنا سکتے ہو جو ہماری آیتوں پر ایمان لاتے ہیں اور وہ فرمانبردار ہو جاتے ہیں",
        "اور جب اُن کے بارے میں (عذاب) کا وعدہ پورا ہوگا تو ہم اُن کے لئے زمین میں سے ایک جانور نکالیں گے جو ان سے بیان کر دے گا۔ اس لئے کہ لوگ ہماری آیتوں پر ایمان نہیں لاتے تھے",
        "اور جس روز ہم ہر اُمت میں سے اس گروہ کو جمع کریں گے جو ہماری آیتوں کی تکذیب کرتے تھے تو اُن کی جماعت بندی کی جائے گی",
        "یہاں تک کہ جب (سب) آجائیں گے تو (خدا) فرمائے گا کہ کیا تم نے میری آیتوں کو جھٹلا دیا تھا اور تم نے (اپنے) علم سے ان پر احاطہ تو کیا ہی نہ تھا۔ بھلا تم کیا کرتے تھے",
        "اور اُن کے ظلم کے سبب اُن کے حق میں وعدہ (عذاب) پورا ہوکر رہے گا تو وہ بول بھی نہ سکیں گے",
        "کیا اُنہوں نے نہیں دیکھا کہ ہم نے رات کو (اس لئے) بنایا ہے کہ اس میں آرام کریں اور دن کو روشن (بنایا ہے کہ اس میں کام کریں) بےشک اس میں مومن لوگوں کے لئے نشانیاں ہیں",
        "اور جس روز صور پھونکا جائے گا تو جو لوگ آسمانوں اور زمین میں ہیں سب گھبرا اُٹھیں گے مگر وہ جسے خدا چاہے اور سب اس کے پاس عاجز ہو کر چلے آئیں گے",
        "اور تم پہاڑوں کو دیکھتے ہو تو خیال کرتے ہو کہ (اپنی جگہ پر) کھڑے ہیں مگر وہ (اس روز) اس طرح اُڑے پھریں گے جیسے بادل۔ (یہ) خدا کی کاریگری ہے جس نے ہر چیز کو مضبوط بنایا۔ بےشک وہ تمہارے سب افعال سے باخبر ہے",
        "جو شخص نیکی لےکر آئے گا تو اس کے لئے اس سے بہتر (بدلہ تیار) ہے اور ایسے لوگ (اُس روز) گھبراہٹ سے بےخوف ہوں گے",
        "اور جو برائی لے کر آئے گا تو ایسے لوگ اوندھے منہ دوزخ میں ڈال دیئے جائیں گے۔ تم کو تو اُن ہی اعمال کا بدلہ ملے گا جو تم کرتے رہے ہو",
        "(کہہ دو) کہ مجھ کو یہی ارشاد ہوا ہے کہ اس شہر (مکہ) کے مالک کی عبادت کروں جس نے اس کو محترم (اور مقام ادب) بنایا ہے اور سب چیز اُسی کی ہے اور یہ بھی حکم ہوا ہے کہ اس کا حکم بردار رہوں",
        "اور یہ بھی کہ قرآن پڑھا کروں۔ تو جو شخص راہ راست اختیار کرتا ہے تو اپنے ہی فائدے کے لئے اختیار کرتا ہے۔ اور جو گمراہ رہتا ہے تو کہہ دو کہ میں تو صرف نصیحت کرنے والا ہوں",
        "اور کہو کہ خدا کا شکر ہے۔ وہ تم کو عنقریب اپنی نشانیاں دکھائے گا تو تم اُن کو پہچان لو گے۔ اور جو کام تم کرتے ہو تمہارا پروردگار اُن سے بےخبر نہیں ہے"
