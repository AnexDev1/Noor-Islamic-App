        "Ṭâ-Sĩn-Mĩm.",
        "These are the verses of the clear Book.",
        "We narrate to you ˹O Prophet˺ part of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for people who believe.",
        "Indeed, Pharaoh ˹arrogantly˺ elevated himself in the land and divided its people into ˹subservient˺ groups, one of which he persecuted, slaughtering their sons and keeping their women. He was truly one of the corruptors.",
        "But it was Our Will to favour those who were oppressed in the land, making them models ˹of faith˺ as well as successors;",
        "and to establish them in the land; and through them show Pharaoh, Hamân, and their soldiers ˹the fulfilment of˺ what they feared.",
        "We inspired the mother of Moses: “Nurse him, but when you fear for him, put him then into the river, and do not fear or grieve. We will certainly return him to you, and make him one of the messengers.”",
        "And ˹it so happened that˺ Pharaoh’s people picked him up, only to become their enemy and source of grief. Surely Pharaoh, Hamân, and their soldiers were sinful.",
        "Pharaoh’s wife said ˹to him˺, “˹This baby is˺ a source of joy for me and you. Do not kill him. Perhaps he may be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son.” They were unaware ˹of what was to come˺.",
        "And the heart of Moses’ mother ached so much that she almost gave away his identity, had We not reassured her heart in order for her to have faith ˹in Allah’s promise˺.",
        "And she said to his sister, “Keep track of him!” So she watched him from a distance, while they were unaware.",
        "And We had caused him to refuse all wet-nurses at first, so his sister suggested, “Shall I direct you to a family who will bring him up for you and take good care of him?”",
        "This is how We returned him to his mother so that her heart would be put at ease, and not grieve, and that she would know that Allah’s promise is ˹always˺ true. But most people do not know.",
        "And when he reached full strength and maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward the good-doers.",
        "˹One day˺ he entered the city unnoticed by its people. There he found two men fighting: one of his own people, and the other of his enemies. The man from his people called to him for help against his foe. So Moses punched him, causing his death. Moses cried, “This is from Satan’s handiwork. He is certainly a sworn, misleading enemy.”",
        "He pleaded, “My Lord! I have definitely wronged my soul, so forgive me.” So He forgave him, ˹for˺ He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "Moses pledged, “My Lord! For all Your favours upon me, I will never side with the wicked.”",
        "And so Moses became fearful, watching out in the city, when suddenly the one who sought his help the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses rebuked him, “Indeed, you are clearly a trouble-maker.”",
        "Then when Moses was about to lay his hands on their foe, the enemy said, “O Moses! Do you intend to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land. You do not intend to make peace!”",
        "And there came a man, rushing from the farthest end of the city. He said, “O Moses! The chiefs are actually conspiring against you to put you to death, so leave ˹the city˺. I really advise you ˹to do so˺.”",
        "So Moses left the city in a state of fear and caution, praying, “My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing people.”",
        "And as he made his way towards Midian, he said, “I trust my Lord will guide me to the right way.”",
        "When he arrived at the well of Midian, he found a group of people watering ˹their herds˺. Apart from them, he noticed two women holding back ˹their herd˺. He asked ˹them˺, “What is the problem?” They replied, “We cannot water ˹our animals˺ until the ˹other˺ shepherds are done, for our father is a very old man.”",
        "So he watered ˹their herd˺ for them, then withdrew to the shade and prayed, “My Lord! I am truly in ˹desperate˺ need of whatever provision You may have in store for me.”",
        "Then one of the two women came to him, walking bashfully. She said, “My father is inviting you so he may reward you for watering ˹our animals˺ for us.” When Moses came to him and told him his whole story, the old man said, “Have no fear! You are ˹now˺ safe from the wrongdoing people.”",
        "One of the two daughters suggested, “O my dear father! Hire him. The best man for employment is definitely the strong and trustworthy ˹one˺.”",
        "The old man proposed, “I wish to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you, provided that you stay in my service for eight years. If you complete ten, it will be ˹a favour˺ from you, but I do not wish to make it difficult for you. Allah willing, you will find me an agreeable man.”",
        "Moses responded, “˹Then˺ it is ˹settled˺ between you and I. Whichever term I fulfill, there will be no ˹further˺ obligation on me. And Allah is a Witness to what we say.”",
        "When Moses had completed the term and was travelling with his family, he spotted a fire on the side of Mount Ṭûr. He said to his family, “Stay here, ˹for˺ I have spotted a fire. Perhaps from there I can bring you some directions or a torch from the fire so you may warm yourselves.”",
        "But when he came to it, he was called from the bush in the sacred ground to the right side of the valley: “O Moses! It is truly I. I am Allah—the Lord of all worlds.",
        "Now, throw down your staff!” But when he saw it slithering like a snake, he ran away without looking back. ˹Allah reassured him,˺ “O Moses! Draw near, and have no fear. You are perfectly secure.",
        "Now put your hand through ˹the opening of˺ your collar, it will come out ˹shining˺ white, unblemished. And cross your arms tightly to calm your fears. These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. They have truly been a rebellious people.”",
        "Moses appealed, “My Lord! I have indeed killed a man from them, so I fear they may kill me.",
        "And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I, so send him with me as a helper to support what I say, for I truly fear they may reject me.”",
        "Allah responded, “We will assist you with your brother and grant you both authority, so they cannot harm you. With Our signs, you and those who follow you will ˹certainly˺ prevail.”",
        "But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said ˹arrogantly˺, “This is nothing but conjured magic ˹tricks˺. We have never heard of this in ˹the history of˺ our forefathers.”",
        "Moses responded, “My Lord knows best who has come with ˹true˺ guidance from Him and will fare best in the end. Indeed, the wrongdoers will never succeed.”",
        "Pharaoh declared, “O chiefs! I know of no other god for you but myself. So bake bricks out of clay for me, O  Hamân, and build a high tower so I may look at the God of Moses, although I am sure he is a liar.”",
        "And so he and his soldiers behaved arrogantly in the land with no right, thinking they would never be returned to Us.",
        "So We seized him and his soldiers, casting them into the sea. See then what was the end of the wrongdoers!",
        "We made them leaders inviting ˹others˺ to the Fire. And on the Day of Judgment they will not be helped.",
        "We caused a curse to follow them in this world. And on the Day of Judgment they will be among the outcasts.",
        "Indeed, We gave Moses the Scripture—after destroying earlier nations—as an insight for the people, a guide, and mercy so perhaps they would be mindful.",
        "You were not there ˹O Prophet˺ on the western side of the mountain when We entrusted the Commandments to Moses, nor were you present ˹in his time˺.",
        "But We ˹later˺ raised ˹several˺ generations, and the ages took their toll on them. Nor were you living among the people of Midian, rehearsing Our revelations with them. But it is We Who have sent ˹this revelation to you˺.",
        "And you were not at the side of Mount Ṭûr when We called out ˹to Moses˺. But ˹you have been sent˺ as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, so perhaps they may be mindful.",
        "Also so they would not say, if struck by an affliction for what their hands have done: “Our Lord! If only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your revelations and become believers.”",
        "But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “If only he was given the like of what Moses had been given.” Did they not deny what had been given to Moses earlier? They claimed, “Both ˹Scriptures˺ are works of magic, supporting each other!” Adding, “We truly deny both.”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Bring then a scripture from Allah which is a better guide than these two so I may follow it, if your claim is true.”",
        "So if they fail to respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. And who could be more astray than those who follow their desires with no guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
        "Indeed, We have steadily delivered the Word ˹of Allah˺ to the people so they may be mindful.",
        "˹As for˺ those ˹faithful˺ to whom We had given the Scripture before this ˹Quran˺, they do believe in it.",
        "When it is recited to them, they declare, “We believe in it. This is definitely the truth from our Lord. We had already submitted ˹even˺ before this.”",
        "These ˹believers˺ will be given a double reward for their perseverance, responding to evil with good, and for donating from what We have provided for them.",
        "When they hear slanderous talk, they turn away from it, saying, “We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. Peace ˹is our only response˺ to you! We want nothing to do with those who act ignorantly.”",
        "You surely cannot guide whoever you like ˹O Prophet˺, but it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills, and He knows best who are ˹fit to be˺ guided.",
        "They say ˹to the Prophet˺, “If we were to follow ˹true˺ guidance with you, we would certainly be snatched away from our land.” Have We not established for them a safe haven ˹in Mecca˺ to which fruits of all kinds are brought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know ˹this favour˺.",
        "˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed that had been spoiled by their ˹comfortable˺ living! Those are their residences, never inhabited after them except passingly. And We ˹alone˺ were the Successor.",
        "Your Lord would never destroy a society until He had sent to its capital a messenger, reciting Our revelations to them. Nor would We ever destroy a society unless its people persisted in wrongdoing.",
        "Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is no more than ˹a fleeting˺ enjoyment and adornment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far better and more lasting. Will you not then understand?",
        "Can those to whom We have made a fine promise—which they will see fulfilled—be like those who We have allowed to enjoy the pleasures of this worldly life, but on the Day of Judgment will be brought ˹for punishment˺?",
        "˹Watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, “Where are those you claimed were My associate-gods?”",
        "Those ˹misleaders˺ against whom the decree ˹of torment˺ is justified will cry, “Our Lord! These ˹followers˺ are the ones we caused to deviate. We led them into deviance, for we ourselves were deviant. We disassociate ourselves ˹from them˺ before You. It was not us that they used to worship.”",
        "It will be said ˹to the disbelievers˺, “Call upon your associate-gods ˹for help˺.” So they will call them, but will receive no response. And they will face the punishment, wishing they had been ˹rightly˺ guided!",
        "And ˹watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, asking, “What response did you give to the messengers?”",
        "They will be too dumbstruck on that Day to ask one another ˹for answers˺.",
        "As for those who repent, believe, and do good ˹in this world˺, it is right to hope that they will be among the successful.",
        "Your Lord creates and chooses whatever He wills—the choice is not theirs. Glorified and Exalted is Allah above what they associate ˹with Him˺!",
        "And your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal.",
        "He is Allah. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. All praise belongs to Him in this life and the next. All authority is His. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.",
        "Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Imagine if Allah were to make the night perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah could bring you sunlight? Will you not then listen?”",
        "Ask ˹them also˺, “Imagine if Allah were to make the day perpetual for you until the Day of Judgment, which god other than Allah could bring you night to rest in? Will you not then see?”",
        "It is out of His mercy that He has made for you the day and night so that you may rest ˹in the latter˺ and seek His bounty ˹in the former˺, and perhaps you will be grateful.",
        "And ˹watch for˺ the Day He will call to them, “Where are those you claimed were My associate-gods?”",
        "And We will bring forth a witness from every faith-community and ask ˹the polytheists˺, “Show ˹Us˺ your proof.” Then they will ˹come to˺ know that the truth is with Allah ˹alone˺. And whatever ˹gods˺ they fabricated will fail them.",
        "Indeed, Korah was from the people of Moses, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. We had granted him such treasures that even their keys would burden a group of strong men. ˹Some of˺ his people advised him, “Do not be prideful! Surely Allah does not like the prideful.",
        "Rather, seek the ˹reward˺ of the Hereafter by means of what Allah has granted you, without forgetting your share of this world. And be good ˹to others˺ as Allah has been good to you. Do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for Allah certainly does not like the corruptors.”",
        "He replied, “I have been granted all this because of some knowledge I have.” Did he not know that Allah had already destroyed some from the generations before him who were far superior to him in power and greater in accumulating ˹wealth˺? There will be no need for the wicked to be asked about their sins.",
        "Then he came out before his people in all his glamour. Those who desired the life of this world wished, “If only we could have something like what Korah has been given. He is truly a man of great fortune!”",
        "But those gifted with knowledge said, “Shame on you! Allah’s reward is far better for those who believe and do good. But none will attain this except the steadfast.”",
        "Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, along with his home. There was no one to help him against Allah, nor could he even help himself.",
        "And those who had craved his position the previous day began to say, “Ah! It is certainly Allah Who gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. Had it not been for the grace of Allah, He could have surely caused the earth to swallow us up! Oh, indeed! The disbelievers will never succeed.”",
        "That ˹eternal˺ Home in the Hereafter We reserve ˹only˺ for those who seek neither tyranny nor corruption on the earth. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous.",
        "Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded with what is better. And whoever comes with an evil deed, then the evildoers will only be rewarded for what they used to do.",
        "Most certainly, the One Who has ordained the Quran for you will ˹ultimately˺ bring you back home ˹to Mecca˺. Say, “My Lord knows best who has come with ˹true˺ guidance and who is clearly astray.”",
        "You never expected this Book to be revealed to you, but ˹it came˺ only ˹as˺ a mercy from your Lord. So never side with the disbelievers ˹in their disbelief˺.",
        "Do not let them turn you away from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down to you. Rather, invite ˹all˺ to ˹the Way of˺ your Lord, and never be one of the polytheists.",
        "And do not invoke any other god with Allah. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. Everything is bound to perish except He Himself. All authority belongs to Him. And to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned."

        "নিশ্চয় ফির‘আউন (মিশর) দেশে উদ্ধত হয়েছিল এবং তার অধিবাসীকে নানা দলে বিভক্ত করেছিল। তাদের একদলকে সে দুর্বল করে রেখেছিল, যাদের পুত্রদেরকে সে হত্যা করত আর কন্যাদেরকে বাঁচিয়ে রাখত। নিশ্চয় সে ছিল বিপর্যয় সৃষ্টিকারীদের অন্যতম।",
        "আর আমি চাইলাম সেই দেশে যাদেরকে দুর্বল করে রাখা হয়েছিল তাদের প্রতি অনুগ্রহ করতে এবং তাদেরকে নেতা বানাতে, আর তাদেরকে উত্তরাধিকারী বানাতে।",
        "আর যমীনে তাদেরকে ক্ষমতায় অধিষ্ঠিত করতে এবং ফির‘আউন, হামান ও তাদের সৈন্যদেরকে দেখিয়ে দিতে, যা তারা তাদের কাছ থেকে আশঙ্কা করছিল।",

        "আর মূসার মায়ের অন্তর বিচলিত হয়ে উঠেছিল। সে তো তার পরিচয় প্রকাশ করেই দিত, যদি আমি তার অন্তরকে দৃঢ় করে না দিতাম, যাতে সে আস্থাশীলদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হয়।",

        "আর সে শহরে প্রবেশ করল, যখন তার অধিবাসীরা ছিল অসতর্ক। তখন সেখানে সে দু’জন লোককে সংঘর্ষে লিপ্ত অবস্থায় পেল। একজন তার নিজের দলের এবং অপরজন তার শত্রুদলের। তখন তার নিজের দলের লোকটি তার শত্রুদলের লোকটির বিরুদ্ধে তার কাছে সাহায্য চাইল। অতঃপর মূসা তাকে ঘুষি মারল ফলে সে তাকে মেরে ফেলল। মূসা বলল, ‘এটা শয়তানের কাজ। নিশ্চয় সে পথভ্রষ্টকারী প্রকাশ্য শত্রু’।",

        "মূসা বলল, ‘হে আমার রব, আপনি যেহেতু আমার প্রতি নিআমত দান করেন, তাই আমি কখনো আর অপরাধীদের সাহায্যকারী হব না।",
        "অতঃপর ভীত প্রতীক্ষারত অবস্থায় সেই শহরে তার সকাল হল। হঠাৎ সে শুনতে পেল, যে লোকটি গতকাল তার কাছে সাহায্য চেয়েছিল, সে আবার সাহায্যের জন্য চিৎকার করছে। মূসা তাকে বলল, ‘নিশ্চয় তুমি তো একজন স্পষ্ট বিভ্রান্ত ব্যক্তি’।",
        "অতঃপর মূসা যখন উভয়েরই শত্রুকে ধরতে চাইল, তখন লোকটি বলে উঠল, ‘হে মূসা, তুমি কি আমাকেও হত্যা করতে চাও? যেমন গতকাল একটি লোককে তুমি হত্যা করেছ? তুমি তো যমীনে কেবল স্বৈরাচারী হতে চাচ্ছ। আর তুমি তো সংশোধনকারীদের মধ্যে অন্তর্ভুক্ত হতে চাচ্ছ না’।",

        "নারীদ্বয়ের একজন বলল, ‘হে আমার পিতা, আপনি তাকে মজুর নিযুক্ত করুন। নিশ্চয় আপনি যাদেরকে মজুর নিযুক্ত করবেন তাদের মধ্যে সে উত্তম, যে শক্তিশালী বিশ্বস্ত’।",
        "সে বলল, ‘আমি আমার এই কন্যাদ্বয়ের একজনকে তোমার সাথে বিয়ে দিতে চাই এই শর্তে যে, তুমি আট বছর আমার মজুরী করবে। আর যদি তুমি দশ বছর পূর্ণ কর, তবে সেটা তোমার পক্ষ থেকে (অতিরিক্ত)। আমি তোমাকে কষ্ট দিতে চাই না। তুমি ইনশাআল্লাহ আমাকে সৎকর্মপরায়ণদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত পাবে’।",
        "মূসা বলল, ‘এ চুক্তি আমার ও আপনার মধ্যে রইল। দু’টি মেয়াদের যেটিই আমি পূরণ করি না কেন, তাতে আমার বিরুদ্ধে অভিযোগ থাকবে না। আর আমরা যে বিষয়ে কথা বলছি, আল্লাহ তার সাক্ষী’।",
        "অতঃপর মূসা যখন মেয়াদ পূর্ণ করল এবং সপরিবারে যাত্রা করল, তখন সে তূর পর্বতের পাশে আগুন দেখতে পেল। সে তার পরিবার পরিজনকে বলল, ‘তোমরা অপেক্ষা কর, আমি আগুন দেখতে পেয়েছি, সম্ভবত আমি তা থেকে তোমাদের কাছে আনতে পারব কোন খবর, অথবা একটি জ্বলন্ত আঙ্গার; যাতে তোমরা আগুন পোহাতে পার’।",
        "অতঃপর যখন মূসা আগুনের নিকট আসল, তখন উপত্যকার ডান পার্শে পবিত্র ভূমিতে অবস্থিত বৃক্ষ থেকে তাকে আহবান করে বলা হলো, ‘হে মূসা, নিশ্চয় আমিই আল্লাহ, সৃষ্টিকুলের রব’।",
        "‘আর তুমি তোমার লাঠি ফেলে দাও’। অতঃপর যখন সে ওটাকে দেখল, সাপের মত ছুটাছুটি করছে, তখন সে পিছনের দিকে ছুটল এবং ফিরেও তাকাল না। (বলা হল) ‘হে মূসা, সামনে যাও এবং ভয় পেয়ো না, নিশ্চয় তুমি নিরাপদ’।",
        "‘তোমার হাত তোমার বগলে রাখ, এটা ত্রুটিমুক্ত অবস্থায় শুভ্রোজ্জ্বল হয়ে বেরিয়ে আসবে। আর ভয় থেকে রক্ষার জন্য তোমার হাত তোমার নিজের দিকে মিলাও। অতঃপর এ দু’টো তোমার রবের পক্ষ থেকে দু’টি প্রমাণ, ফির‘আউন ও তার পারিষদবর্গের জন্য। নিশ্চয় তারা ফাসিক কওম’।",
        "মূসা বলল, ‘হে আমার রব, নিশ্চয় আমি তাদের এক ব্যক্তিকে হত্যা করেছি, তাই আমি আশঙ্কা করছি যে, তারা আমাকে হত্যা করবে’।",
        "‘আর আমার ভাই হারূন, সে আমার চেয়ে স্পষ্টভাষী, তাই তাকে আমার সাথে সাহায্যকারী হিসেবে প্রেরণ করুন, সে আমাকে সমর্থন করবে। আমি আশঙ্কা করছি যে, তারা আমাকে মিথ্যাবাদী বলবে।",
        "আল্লাহ বললেন, ‘আমি তোমার ভাইয়ের মাধ্যমে তোমার বাহু শক্তিশালী করব এবং তোমাদের দু’জনকে ক্ষমতা দান করব, ফলে তারা তোমাদের কাছে পৌঁছতে পারবে না। আমার নিদর্শনাবলী দ্বারা তোমরা ও তোমাদের অনুসারীরা বিজয়ী হবে’।",
        "অতঃপর মূসা যখন তাদের কাছে আমার সুস্পষ্ট নিদর্শনগুলো নিয়ে আসল, তখন তারা বলল, ‘এ তো মিথ্যা যাদু ছাড়া আর কিছুই নয় এবং এরূপ কথা আমাদের পিতৃপুরুষদের মধ্যেও শুনিনি’।",
        "আর মূসা বলল, ‘আমার রব সম্যক অবগত আছেন, কে তাঁর কাছ থেকে হিদায়াত নিয়ে এসেছে এবং আখিরাতে কার পরিণাম শুভ হবে। নিশ্চয় যালিমরা সফল হবে না’।",
        "আর ফির‘আউন বলল, ‘হে পারিষদবর্গ, আমি ছাড়া তোমাদের কোন ইলাহ আছে বলে আমি জানি না। অতএব হে হামান, আমার জন্য তুমি ইট পোড়াও, তারপর আমার জন্য একটি প্রাসাদ তৈরী কর। যাতে আমি মূসার ইলাহকে দেখতে পাই। আর নিশ্চয় আমি মনে করি সে মিথ্যাবাদীদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত’।",
        "আর ফির‘আউন ও তার সেনাবাহিনী অন্যায়ভাবে যমীনে অহঙ্কার করেছিল এবং তারা মনে করেছিল যে, তাদেরকে আমার নিকট ফিরিয়ে আনা হবে না।",
        "অতঃপর আমি তাকে ও তার সেনাবাহিনীকে পাকড়াও করলাম, তারপর তাদেরকে সমুদ্রে নিক্ষেপ করলাম। অতএব, দেখ যালিমদের পরিণাম কিরূপ হয়েছিল?",
        "আর আমি তাদেরকে নেতা বানিয়েছিলাম, তারা জাহান্নামের দিকে আহবান করত এবং কিয়ামতের দিন তাদেরকে সাহায্য করা হবে না।",
        "এ যমীনে আমি তাদের পিছনে অভিসম্পাত লাগিয়ে দিয়েছি আর কিয়ামতের দিন তারা হবে ঘৃণিতদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত।",
        "আর অবশ্যই আমি পূর্ববর্তী বহু প্রজন্মকে ধ্বংস করার পর মানুষের জন্য আলোকবর্তিকা, হিদায়াত ও রহমতস্বরূপ মূসাকে কিতাব দিয়েছিলাম। যাতে তারা উপদেশ গ্রহণ করে।",
        "আর (হে নবী) আমি যখন মূসাকে বিধান দিয়েছিলাম তখন তুমি (তূর পাহাড়ের) পশ্চিম পার্শে উপস্থিত ছিলে না। আর তুমি প্রত্যক্ষদর্শীদের অন্তর্ভুক্তও ছিলে না।",
        "কিন্তু আমি অনেক প্রজন্মকে সৃষ্টি করেছি। তারপর তাদের উপর বহু যুগ অতিবাহিত হয়েছিল। তুমি তো মাদইয়ানবাসীদের মধ্যে অবস্থানকারী ছিলে না যে, তাদের নিকট আমার আয়াতগুলো তুমি তিলাওয়াত করবে। কিন্তু আমিই রাসূল প্রেরণকারী।",
        "আর যখন আমি (মূসাকে) ডেকেছিলাম তখন তুমি তূর পর্বতের পাশে উপস্থিত ছিলে না। কিন্তু তোমার রবের পক্ষ থেকে রহমতস্বরূপ জানানো হয়েছে, যাতে তুমি এমন কওমকে সতর্ক করতে পার, যাদের কাছে তোমার পূর্বে কোন সতর্ককারী আসেনি। সম্ভবত তারা উপদেশ গ্রহণ করবে।",
        "তাদের কৃতকর্মের কারণে তাদের উপর কোন বিপদ আসলে তারা যাতে বলতে না পারে, ‘হে আমাদের রব, আপনি আমাদের কাছে কোন রাসূল পাঠালেন না কেন? তাহলে আমরা আপনার আয়াতসমূহ অনুসরণ করতাম আর আমরা মুমিনদের অন্তর্ভুর্ক্ত হতাম’।",
        "অতঃপর যখন আমার নিকট থেকে তাদের কাছে সত্য আসল তখন তারা বলল, ‘মূসাকে যা দেয়া হয়েছিল তাকে(মুহাম্মাদকে) কেন সেরূপ দেয়া হল না’? ইতঃপূর্বে মূসাকে যা দেয়া হয়েছিল তারা কি তা অস্বীকার করেনি? তারা বলেছিল, ‘দু’টিই যাদু, একটি অপরটিকে সাহায্য করে’। আর তারা বলেছিল, ‘আমরা সবই অস্বীকারকারী’।",
        "বল, ‘তাহলে তোমরা আল্লাহর কাছ থেকে এমন একটি কিতাব নিয়ে আস যা এ দু’টো কিতাব থেকে উৎকৃষ্ট; আমি তারই অনুসরণ করব, যদি তোমরা সত্যবাদী হয়ে থাক’।",
        "অতঃপর তারা যদি তোমার আহবানে সাড়া না দেয়, তাহলে জেনে রাখ, তারা তো নিজদের খেয়াল খুশীর অনুসরণ করে। আর আল্লাহর দিকনির্দেশনা ছাড়া যে নিজের খেয়াল খুশীর অনুসরণ করে তার চেয়ে অধিক পথভ্রষ্ট আর কে? নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ যালিম কওমকে হিদায়াত করেন না।",
        "আর আমি তো তাদের কাছে একের পর এক বাণী পৌঁছে দিয়েছি, যাতে তারা উপদেশ গ্রহণ করে।",
        "এর পূর্বে আমি যাদেরকে কিতাব দিয়েছিলাম তারা এর প্রতি ঈমান আনে।",
        "আর যখন তাদের নিকট তা তিলাওয়াত করা হয় তখন তারা বলে, ‘আমরা এর প্রতি ঈমান এনেছি, নিশ্চয় তা সত্য আমাদের রবের পক্ষ থেকে। নিশ্চয় আমরা এর পূর্বেও আত্মসমর্পণকারী ছিলাম’।",
        "তাদেরকে দু’বার প্রতিদান দেয়া হবে। এ কারণে যে, তারা ধৈর্যধারণ করে এবং ভাল দ্বারা মন্দকে প্রতিহত করে। আর আমি তাদেরকে যে রিয্ক দিয়েছি তা থেকে ব্যয় করে।",
        "আর তারা যখন অনর্থক কথাবার্তা শুনে তখন তা থেকে বিমুখ হয় এবং বলে, ‘আমাদের আমল আমাদের জন্য, আর তোমাদের আমল তোমাদের জন্য। তোমাদের প্রতি ‘সালাম’। আমরা অজ্ঞদের সাহচর্য চাই না’।",
        "নিশ্চয় তুমি যাকে ভালবাস তাকে তুমি হিদায়াত দিতে পারবে না; বরং আল্লাহই যাকে ইচ্ছা হিদায়াত দেন। আর হিদায়াতপ্রাপ্তদের ব্যাপারে তিনি ভাল জানেন।",
        "আর তারা বলে, ‘আমরা যদি তোমার সাথে হিদায়াতের অনুসরণ করি তবে আমাদেরকে আমাদের দেশ থেকে উৎখাত করা হবে’। আমি কি তাদের জন্য এক নিরাপদ ‘হারাম’ এর সুব্যবস্থা করিনি? সেখানে সব ধরনের ফলমূল আমদানী করা হয়, আমার পক্ষ থেকে রিয্কস্বরূপ? কিন্তু তাদের অধিকাংশই তা জানে না।",
        "আর আমি কত জনপদকে ধ্বংস করেছি, যার বাসিন্দারা তাদের জীবন উপকরণ নিয়ে দম্ভ করত! এগুলো তো তাদের বাসস্থান। তাদের পরে (এখানে) সামান্যই বসবাস করা হয়েছে। আর আমিই চূড়ান্ত মালিকানার ওয়ারিস।",
        "আর তোমার রব কোন জনপদকে ধ্বংস করেন না, যতক্ষণ না তিনি তার মূল ভূখন্ডে রাসূল প্রেরণ করেন, যে তাদের কাছে আমার আয়াতসমূহ তিলাওয়াত করে। আর কোন জনপদের অধিবাসীরা যালিম না হলে আমি তাদেরকে ধ্বংস করি না।",
        "আর তোমাদেরকে যা কিছু দেয়া হয়েছে তা দুনিয়ার জীবনের ভোগ ও সৌন্দর্য মাত্র। আর আল্লাহর কাছে যা আছে তাই উত্তম ও স্থায়ী। তোমরা কি বুঝবে না?",
        "আমি যাকে উত্তম ওয়াদা দিয়েছি সে তা পাবেই; সে কি তার মতই যাকে আমি দুনিয়ার জীবনের ভোগসামগ্রী দিয়েছি? তারপর কিয়ামতের দিনে সে উপস্থিতকৃতদের মধ্যে থাকবে।",
        "আর সে দিন তিনি তাদেরকে আহবান করবেন, অতঃপর বলবেন, ‘তোমরা যাদেরকে আমার শরীক মনে করতে তারা কোথায়’?",
        "যাদের জন্য (শাস্তির) বাণী অবধারিত হবে তারা বলবে, ‘হে আমাদের রব, ওরা তো তারা যাদেরকে আমরা বিভ্রান্ত করেছিলাম। তাদেরকে আমরা বিভ্রান্ত করেছিলাম যেমন আমরা বিভ্রান্ত হয়েছিলাম। আমরা আপনার কাছে দায় মুক্তি চাচ্ছি। তারা তো আমাদের ইবাদাত করত না’।",
        "আর বলা হবে, ‘তোমাদের দেবতাগুলোকে ডাক, অতঃপর তারা তাদেরকে ডাকবে, তখন তারা তাদের ডাকে সাড়া দেবে না। আর তারা আযাব দেখতে পাবে। হায়, এরা যদি সৎপথ প্রাপ্ত হত!",
        "আর সেদিন আল্লাহ তাদেরকে ডেকে বলবেন, ‘তোমরা রাসূলদেরকে কী জবাব দিয়েছিলে’?",
        "অতঃপর সেদিন সকল সংবাদ তাদের কাছ থেকে গোপন হয়ে যাবে, তখন তারা পরস্পরকে জিজ্ঞাসা করতে পারবে না।",
        "তবে যে তাওবা করেছিল, ঈমান এনেছিল এবং সৎকর্ম করেছিল, আশা করা যায় সে সাফল্য অর্জনকারীদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হবে।",
        "আর তোমার রব যা ইচ্ছা সৃষ্টি করেন এবং মনোনীত করেন, তাদের কোন এখতিয়ার নাই। আল্লাহ পবিত্র মহান এবং তারা যা শরীক করে তিনি তা থেকে ঊর্ধ্বে।",
        "আর তোমার রব জানেন, তাদের অন্তর যা গোপন করে আর তারা যা প্রকাশ করে।",
        "আর তিনিই আল্লাহ, তিনি ছাড়া কোন (সত্য) ইলাহ নেই। দুনিয়া ও আখিরাতে সমস্ত প্রশংসা তাঁরই; বিধান তাঁরই। আর তাঁর কাছেই তোমরা প্রত্যাবর্তিত হবে।",
        "বল, ‘তোমরা ভেবে দেখেছ কি, যদি আল্লাহ রাতকে তোমাদের উপর কিয়ামত পর্যন্ত স্থায়ী করে দেন, তবে তাঁর পরিবর্তে কোন ইলাহ আছে কি যে তোমাদের আলো এনে দেবে? তবুও কি তোমরা শুনবে না’?",
        "বল, ‘তোমরা ভেবে দেখেছ কি, যদি আল্লাহ দিনকে তোমাদের উপর কিয়ামত পর্যন্ত স্থায়ী করে দেন, তবে তাঁর পরিবর্তে কোন ইলাহ আছে কি, যে তোমাদের রাত এনে দেবে যাতে তোমরা বিশ্রাম করবে? তবুও কি তোমরা ভেবে দেখবে না’?",
        "আর তাঁর অনুগ্রহে তিনি তোমাদের জন্য রাত ও দিন করেছেন যাতে তোমরা বিশ্রাম নিতে পার এবং তাঁর অনুগ্রহ সন্ধান করতে পার এবং যেন তোমরা শোকর আদায় করতে পার।",
        "আর সেদিন তিনি তাদের ডাকবেন। অতঃপর বলবেন, ‘তোমরা যাদেরকে আমার শরীক মনে করতে তারা কোথায়’?",
        "আর আমি প্রত্যেক জাতি থেকে একজন সাক্ষী বের করে নেব। অতঃপর আমি বলব, ‘তোমাদের প্রমাণ নিয়ে আস’। তখন তারা জানতে পারবে যে, নিশ্চয় সত্য আল্লাহর কাছেই এবং তারা যে সব মিথ্যা উদ্ভাবন করত তা তাদের থেকে হারিয়ে যাবে।",
        "নিশ্চয় কারূন ছিল মূসার কওমভুক্ত। অতঃপর সে তাদের উপর ঔদ্ধত্য প্রকাশ করে। অথচ আমি তাকে এমন ধনভান্ডার দান করেছিলাম যে, নিশ্চয় তার চাবিগুলো একদল শক্তিশালী লোকের উপর ভারী হয়ে যেত। স্মরণ কর, যখন তার কওম তাকে বলল, ‘দম্ভ করো না। নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ দাম্ভিকদের ভালবাসেন না’।",
        "আর আল্লাহ তোমাকে যা দান করেছেন তাতে তুমি আখিরাতের নিবাস অনুসন্ধান কর। তবে তুমি দুনিয়া থেকে তোমার অংশ ভুলে যেয়ো না। তোমার প্রতি আল্লাহ যেরূপ অনুগ্রহ করেছেন তুমিও সেরূপ অনুগ্রহ কর। আর যমীনে ফাসাদ করতে চেয়ো না। নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ ফাসাদকারীদের ভালবাসেন না’।",
        "সে বলল, ‘আমি তো এই ধনভান্ডার প্রাপ্ত হয়েছি আমার কাছে থাকা জ্ঞান দ্বারা’। সে কি জানত না যে, আল্লাহ তার পূর্বে বহু প্রজন্মকে ধ্বংস করে দিয়েছেন, যারা ছিল তার থেকে শক্তিমত্তায় প্রবলতর এবং জনসংখ্যায় অধিক। আর অপরাধীদেরকে তাদের অপরাধ সম্পর্কে প্রশ্ন করা হবে না।",
        "অতঃপর সে তার কওমের সামনে জাঁকজমকের সাথে বের হল। যারা দুনিয়ার জীবন চাইত তারা বলল, ‘আহা! কারূনকে যেমন দেয়া হয়েছে আমাদেরও যদি তেমন থাকত! নিশ্চয় সে বিরাট সম্পদশালী।’",
        "আর যারা জ্ঞান প্রাপ্ত হয়েছিল, তারা বলল, ‘ধিক তোমাদেরকে! আল্লাহর প্রতিদানই উত্তম যে ঈমান আনে ও সৎকর্ম করে তার জন্য। আর তা শুধু সবরকারীরাই পেতে পারে।’",
        "অতঃপর আমি কারূন ও তার প্রাসাদকে মাটিতে দাবিয়ে দিলাম। তখন তার জন্য এমন কোন দল ছিল না, যে আল্লাহর মোকাবিলায় তাকে সাহায্য করতে পারত এবং সে নিজেও নিজেকে সাহায্য করতে সক্ষম ছিল না।",
        "আর গতকাল যারা তার মত হতে প্রত্যাশা করেছিল তারা বলতে লাগল, ‘আশ্চর্য! দেখলে তো, আল্লাহ তাঁর বান্দাদের মধ্য থেকে যার জন্য ইচ্ছা রিয্ক প্রসারিত অথবা সংকুচিত করেন। যদি আল্লাহ আমাদের প্রতি অনুগ্রহ না করতেন তবে আমাদেরকেও তিনি দাবিয়ে দিতেন। দেখলে তো, কাফিররা সফল হয় না’।",
        "এই হচ্ছে আখিরাতের নিবাস, যা আমি তাদের জন্য নির্ধারিত করি, যারা যমীনে ঔদ্ধত্য দেখাতে চায় না এবং ফাসাদও চায় না। আর শুভ পরিণাম মুত্তাকীদের জন্য।",
        "কেউ পূণ্য নিয়ে আসলে তার জন্য থাকবে তা থেকে উত্তম প্রতিদান। আর কেউ পাপ নিয়ে আসলে তবে যারা মন্দকর্ম করেছে তাদের শুধু তারই প্রতিদান দেওয়া হবে যা তারা করেছে।",
        "নিশ্চয় যিনি তোমার প্রতি কুরআনকে বিধানস্বরূপ দিয়েছেন, অবশ্যই তিনি তোমাকে প্রত্যাবর্তনস্থলে* ফিরিয়ে নেবেন। বল, ‘আমার রব বেশী জানেন, কে হিদায়াত নিয়ে এসেছে, আর কে রয়েছে স্পষ্ট পথভ্রষ্টতায়’। \n* معاد বা প্রত্যাবর্তনস্থল বলতে স্বদেশ অর্থাৎ মক্কা নগরী অথবা আখিরাতকে বুঝানো হয়েছে।",
        "আর তুমি আশা করছিলে না যে, তোমার প্রতি কিতাব (কুরআন) নাযিল করা হবে, বরং তা তোমার রবের পক্ষ থেকে রহমতস্বরূপ। অতএব, তুমি কখনো কাফিরদের জন্য সাহায্যকারী হয়ো না।",
        "আর আল্লাহর আয়াতসমূহ তোমার প্রতি নাযিল হওয়ার পর তারা যেন তোমাকে তা থেকে বিরত রাখতে না পারে, তোমার রবের প্রতি তুমি আহবান কর এবং তুমি মুশরিকদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হয়ো না।",
        "আল্লাহর সাথে অন্য কোন ইলাহকে ডেকো না, তিনি ছাড়া কোন (সত্য) ইলাহ নেই। তাঁর চেহারা (সত্ত্বা)* ছাড়া সব কিছুই ধ্বংসশীল, সিদ্ধান্ত তাঁরই এবং তাঁর কাছেই তোমাদেরকে ফিরিয়ে নেয়া হবে। \n* আয়াতে উল্লিখিত وجه শব্দের অর্থ চেহারা। আল্লাহর চেহারা আছে। আর তাঁর চেহারা যেমন ধ্বংসশীল নয় তেমনি তাঁর সত্ত্বাও ধ্বংসশীল নয়।"

        "یہ کتاب روشن کی آیتیں ہیں",
        "(اے محمدﷺ) ہم تمہیں موسٰی اور فرعون کے کچھ حالات مومن لوگوں کو سنانے کے لئے صحیح صحیح سناتے ہیں",
        "کہ فرعون نے ملک میں سر اُٹھا رکھا تھا اور وہاں کے باشندوں کو گروہ گروہ بنا رکھا تھا اُن میں سے ایک گروہ کو (یہاں تک) کمزور کر دیا تھا کہ اُن کے بیٹوں کو ذبح کر ڈالتا اور اُن کی لڑکیوں کو زندہ رہنے دیتا۔ بیشک وہ مفسدوں میں تھا",
        "اور ہم چاہتے تھے کہ جو لوگ ملک میں کمزور کر دیئے گئے ہیں اُن پر احسان کریں اور اُن کو پیشوا بنائیں اور انہیں (ملک کا) وارث کریں",
        "اور ملک میں ان کو قدرت دیں اور فرعون اور ہامان اور اُن کے لشکر کو وہ چیزیں دکھا دیں جس سے وہ ڈرتے تھے",
        "اور ہم نے موسٰی کی ماں کی طرف وحی بھیجی کہ اس کو دودھ پلاؤ جب تم کو اس کے بارے میں کچھ خوف پیدا ہو تو اسے دریا میں ڈال دینا اور نہ تو خوف کرنا اور نہ رنج کرنا۔ ہم اس کو تمہارے پاس واپس پہنچا دیں گے اور (پھر) اُسے پیغمبر بنا دیں گے",
        "تو فرعون کے لوگوں نے اس کو اُٹھا لیا اس لئے کہ (نتیجہ یہ ہونا تھا کہ) وہ اُن کا دشمن اور (ان کے لئے موجب) غم ہو۔ بیشک فرعون اور ہامان اور اُن کے لشکر چوک گئے",
        "اور فرعون کی بیوی نے کہا کہ (یہ) میری اور تمہاری (دونوں کی) آنکھوں کی ٹھنڈک ہے اس کو قتل نہ کرنا۔ شاید یہ ہمیں فائدہ پہنچائے یا ہم اُسے بیٹا بنالیں اور وہ انجام سے بےخبر تھے",
        "اور موسٰی کی ماں کا دل بے صبر ہو گیا اگر ہم اُن کے دل مضبوط نہ کر دیتے تو قریب تھا کہ وہ اس (قصّے) کو ظاہر کر دیں۔ غرض یہ تھی کہ وہ مومنوں میں رہیں",
        "اور اس کی بہن سے کہا کہ اس کے پیچھے پیچھے چلی جا تو وہ اُسے دور سے دیکھتی رہی اور ان (لوگوں) کو کچھ خبر نہ تھی",
        "اور ہم نے پہلے ہی سے اس پر (دائیوں) کے دودھ حرام کر دیئے تھے۔ تو موسٰی کی بہن نے کہا کہ میں تمہیں ایسے گھر والے بتاؤں کہ تمہارے لئے اس (بچے) کو پالیں اور اس کی خیر خواہی (سے پرورش) کریں",
        "تو ہم نے (اس طریق سے) اُن کو ان کی ماں کے پاس واپس پہنچا دیا تاکہ اُن کی آنکھیں ٹھنڈی ہوں اور وہ غم نہ کھائیں اور معلوم کریں کہ خدا کا وعدہ سچا ہے لیکن یہ اکثر نہیں جانتے",
        "اور جب موسٰی جوانی کو پہنچے اور بھرپور (جوان) ہو گئے تو ہم نے اُن کو حکمت اور علم عنایت کیا۔ اور ہم نیکو کاروں کو ایسا ہی بدلہ دیا کرتے ہیں",
        "اور وہ ایسے وقت شہر میں داخل ہوئے کہ وہاں کے باشندے بےخبر ہو رہے تھے تو دیکھا کہ وہاں دو شخص لڑ رہے تھے ایک تو موسٰی کی قوم کا ہے اور دوسرا اُن کے دشمنوں میں سے تو جو شخص اُن کی قوم میں سے تھا اس نے دوسرے شخص کے مقابلے میں جو موسٰی کے دشمنوں میں سے تھا مدد طلب کی تو اُنہوں نے اس کو مکا مارا اور اس کا کام تمام کر دیا کہنے لگے کہ یہ کام تو (اغوائے) شیطان سے ہوا بیشک وہ (انسان کا) دشمن اور صریح بہکانے والا ہے",
        "بولے کہ اے پروردگار میں نے اپنے آپ پر ظلم کیا تو مجھے بخش دے تو خدا نے اُن کو بخش دیا۔ بیشک وہ بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "کہنے لگے کہ اے پروردگار تو نے جو مجھ پر مہربانی فرمائی ہے میں (آئندہ) کبھی گنہگاروں کا مددگار نہ بنوں",
        "الغرض صبح کے وقت شہر میں ڈرتے ڈرتے داخل ہوئے کہ دیکھیں (کیا ہوتا ہے) تو ناگہاں وہی شخص جس نے کل اُن سے مدد مانگی تھی پھر اُن کو پکار رہا ہے۔ موسٰی نے اس سے کہا کہ تُو تو صریح گمراہ ہے",
        "جب موسٰی نے ارادہ کیا کہ اس شخص کو جو ان دونوں کا دشمن تھا پکڑ لیں تو وہ (یعنی موسٰی کی قوم کا آدمی) بول اُٹھا کہ جس طرح تم نے کل ایک شخص کو مار ڈالا تھا اسی طرح چاہتے ہو کہ مجھے بھی مار ڈالو۔ تم تو یہی چاہتے ہو کہ ملک میں ظلم وستم کرتے پھرو اور یہ نہیں چاہتے ہو کہ نیکو کاروں میں ہو",
        "اور ایک شخص شہر کی پرلی طرف سے دوڑتا ہوا آیا (اور) بولا کہ موسٰی (شہر کے) رئیس تمہارے بارے میں صلاحیں کرتے ہیں کہ تم کو مار ڈالیں سو تم یہاں سے نکل جاؤ۔ میں تمہارا خیر خواہ ہوں",
        "موسٰی وہاں سے ڈرتے ڈرتے نکل کھڑے ہوئے کہ دیکھیں (کیا ہوتا ہے) اور دعا کرنے لگے کہ اے پروردگار مجھے ظالم لوگوں سے نجات دے۔",
        "اور جب مدین کی طرف رخ کیا تو کہنے لگے اُمید ہے کہ میرا پروردگار مجھے سیدھا رستہ بتائے",
        "اور جب مدین کے پانی (کے مقام) پر پہنچے تو دیکھا کہ وہاں لوگ جمع ہو رہے (اور اپنے چارپایوں کو) پانی پلا رہے ہیں اور ان کے ایک طرف دو عورتیں (اپنی بکریوں کو) روکے کھڑی ہیں۔ موسٰی نے (اُن سے) کہا تمہارا کیا کام ہے۔ وہ بولیں کہ جب تک چرواہے (اپنے چارپایوں کو) لے نہ جائیں ہم پانی نہیں پلا سکتے اور ہمارے والد بڑی عمر کے بوڑھے ہیں",
        "تو موسٰی نے اُن کے لئے (بکریوں کو) پانی پلا دیا پھر سائے کی طرف چلے گئے۔ اور کہنے لگے کہ پروردگار میں اس کا محتاج ہوں کہ تو مجھ پر اپنی نعمت نازل فرمائے",
        "(تھوڑی دیر کے بعد) ان میں سے ایک عورت جو شرماتی اور لجاتی چلی آتی تھی۔ موسٰی کے پاس آئی اور کہنے لگی کہ تم کو میرے والد بلاتے ہیں کہ تم نے جو ہمارے لئے پانی پلایا تھا اس کی تم کو اُجرت دیں۔ جب وہ اُن کے پاس آئے اور اُن سے اپنا ماجرا بیان کیا تو اُنہوں نے کہا کہ کچھ خوف نہ کرو۔ تم ظالم لوگوں سے بچ آئے ہو",
        "ایک لڑکی بولی کہ ابّا ان کو نوکر رکھ لیجئے کیونکہ بہتر نوکر جو آپ رکھیں وہ ہے (جو) توانا اور امانت دار (ہو)",
        "اُنہوں نے( موسٰی سے) کہا کہ میں چاہتا ہوں اپنی دو بیٹیوں میں سے ایک کو تم سے بیاہ دوں اس عہد پر کہ تم آٹھ برس میری خدمت کرو اور اگر دس سال پورے کر دو تو تمہاری طرف سے (احسان) ہے اور میں تم پر تکلیف ڈالنی نہیں چاہتا۔ مجھے انشاء الله نیک لوگوں میں پاؤ گے",
        "موسٰی نے کہا کہ مجھ میں اور آپ میں یہ (عہد پختہ ہوا) میں جونسی مدت (چاہوں) پوری کردوں پھر مجھ پر کوئی زیادتی نہ ہو۔ اور ہم جو معاہدہ کرتے ہیں خدا اس کا گواہ ہے",
        "جب موسٰی نے مدت پوری کردی اور اپنے گھر کے لوگوں کو لے کر چلے تو طور کی طرف سے آگ دکھائی دی تو اپنے گھر والوں سے کہنے لگے کہ تم یہاں ٹھیرو۔ مجھے آگ نظر آئی ہے شاید میں وہاں سے (رستے کا) کچھ پتہ لاؤں یا آگ کا انگارہ لے آؤں تاکہ تم تاپو",
        "جب اس کے پاس پہنچے تو میدان کے دائیں کنارے سے ایک مبارک جگہ میں ایک درخت میں سے آواز آئی کہ موسٰی میں تو خدائے رب العالمین ہوں",
        "اور یہ کہ اپنی لاٹھی ڈالدو۔ جب دیکھا کہ وہ حرکت کر رہی ہے گویا سانپ ہے، تو پیٹھ پھیر کر چل دیئے اور پیچھے پھر کر بھی نہ دیکھا۔ (ہم نے کہا کہ) موسٰی آگے آؤ اور ڈرومت تم امن پانے والوں میں ہو",
        "اپنا ہاتھ گریبان میں ڈالو تو بغیر کسی عیب کے سفید نکل آئے گا اور خوف دور ہونے (کی وجہ) سے اپنے بازو کو اپنی طرف سیکڑلو۔ یہ دو دلیلیں تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے ہیں (ان کے ساتھ) فرعون اور اس کے درباریوں کے پاس جاؤ کہ وہ نافرمان لوگ ہیں",
        "موسٰی نے کہا اے پروردگار اُن میں کا ایک شخص میرے ہاتھ سے قتل ہوچکا ہے سو مجھے خوف ہے کہ وہ (کہیں) مجھ کو مار نہ ڈالیں",
        "اور ہارون (جو) میرا بھائی (ہے) اس کی زبان مجھ سے زیادہ فصیح ہے تو اس کو میرے ساتھ مددگار بناکر بھیج کہ میری تصدیق کرے مجھے خوف ہے کہ وہ میری لوگ تکذیب کریں گے",
        "(خدا نے) فرمایا ہم تمہارے بھائی سے تمہارے بازو مضبوط کریں گے اور تم دونوں کو غلبہ دیں گے تو ہماری نشانیوں کے سبب وہ تم تک پہنچ نہ سکیں گے (اور) تم اور جنہوں نے تمہاری پیروی کی غالب رہو گے",
        "اور جب موسٰی اُن کے پاس ہماری کھلی نشانیاں لےکر آئے تو وہ کہنے لگے کہ یہ جادو ہے جو اُس نے بنا کھڑا کیا ہے اور یہ باتیں ہم نے اپنے اگلے باپ دادا میں تو (کبھی) سنی نہیں",
        "اور موسٰی نے کہا کہ میرا پروردگار اس شخص کو خوب جانتا ہے جو اس کی طرف سے حق لےکر آیا ہے اور جس کے لئے عاقبت کا گھر (یعنی بہشت) ہے۔ بیشک ظالم نجات نہیں پائیں گے",
        "اور فرعون نے کہا کہ اے اہلِ دربار میں تمہارا اپنے سوا کسی کو خدا نہیں جانتا تو ہامان میرے لئے گارے کو آگ لگوا (کر اینٹیں پکوا) دو پھر ایک (اُونچا) محل بنادو تاکہ میں موسٰی کے خدا کی طرف چڑھ جاؤں اور میں تو اُسے جھوٹا سمجھتا ہوں",
        "اور وہ اور اس کے لشکر ملک میں ناحق مغرور ہورہے تھے اور خیال کرتے تھے کہ وہ ہماری طرف لوٹ کر نہیں آئیں گے",
        "تو ہم نے اُن کو اور اُن کے لشکروں کو پکڑلیا اور دریا میں ڈال دیا۔ سو دیکھ لو ظالموں کا کیسا انجام ہوا",
        "اور ہم نے ان کو پیشوا بنایا تھا وہ (لوگوں) کو دوزخ کی طرف بلاتے تھے اور قیامت کے دن اُن کی مدد نہیں کی جائے گی",
        "اور اس دنیا سے ہم نے اُن کے پیچھے لعنت لگادی اور وہ قیامت کے روز بھی بدحالوں میں ہوں گے",
        "اور ہم نے پہلی اُمتوں کے ہلاک کرنے کے بعد موسٰی کو کتاب دی جو لوگوں کے لئے بصیرت اور ہدایت اور رحمت ہے تاکہ وہ نصیحت پکڑیں",
        "اور جب ہم نے موسٰی کی طرف حکم بھیجا تو تم (طور کی) غرب کی طرف نہیں تھے اور نہ اس واقعے کے دیکھنے والوں میں تھے",
        "لیکن ہم نے (موسٰی کے بعد) کئی اُمتوں کو پیدا کیا پھر ان پر مدت طویل گذر گئی اور نہ تم مدین والوں میں رہنے والے تھے کہ ان کو ہماری آیتیں پڑھ پڑھ کر سناتے تھے۔ ہاں ہم ہی تو پیغمبر بھیجنے والے تھے",
        "اور نہ تم اس وقت جب کہ ہم نے (موسٰی کو) آواز دی طور کے کنارے تھے بلکہ (تمہارا بھیجا جانا) تمہارے پروردگار کی رحمت ہے تاکہ تم اُن لوگوں کو جن کے پاس تم سے پہلے کوئی ہدایت کرنے والا نہیں آیا ہدایت کرو تاکہ وہ نصیحت پکڑیں",
        "اور (اے پیغمبر ہم نے تو کو اس لئے بھیجا ہے کہ) ایسا نہ ہو کہ اگر ان (اعمال) کے سبب جو اُن کے ہاتھ آگے بھیج چکے ہیں ان پر کوئی مصیبت واقع ہو تو یہ کہنے لگیں کہ اے پروردگار تو نے ہماری طرف کوئی پیغمبر کیوں نہ بھیجا کہ ہم تیری آیتوں کی پیروی کرنے اور ایمان لانے والوں میں ہوتے",
        "پھر جب اُن کے پاس ہماری طرف سے حق آپہنچا تو کہنے لگے کہ جیسی (نشانیاں) موسٰی کو ملی تھیں ویسی اس کو کیوں نہیں ملیں۔ کیا جو (نشانیاں) پہلے موسٰی کو دی گئی تھیں اُنہوں نے اُن سے کفر نہیں کیا۔ کہنے لگے کہ دونوں جادوگر ہیں ایک دوسرے کے موافق۔ اور بولے کہ ہم سب سے منکر ہیں",
        "کہہ دو کہ اگر سچے ہو تو تم خدا کے پاس سے کوئی کتاب لے آؤ جو ان دونوں (کتابوں) سے بڑھ کر ہدایت کرنے والی ہو۔ تاکہ میں بھی اسی کی پیروی کروں",
        "پھر اگر یہ تمہاری بات قبول نہ کریں تو جان لو کہ یہ صرف اپنی خواہشوں کی پیروی کرتے ہیں۔ اور اس سے زیادہ کون گمراہ ہوگا جو خدا کی ہدایت کو چھوڑ کر اپنی خواہش کے پیچھے چلے۔ بیشک خدا ظالم لوگوں کو ہدایت نہیں دیتا",
        "اور ہم پے درپے اُن لوگوں کے پاس (ہدایت کی) باتیں بھیجتے رہے ہیں تاکہ نصیحت پکڑیں",
        "جن لوگوں کو ہم نے اس سے پہلے کتاب دی تھی وہ اس پر ایمان لے آتے ہیں",
        "اور جب (قرآن) اُن کو پڑھ کر سنایا جاتا ہے تو کہتے ہیں کہ ہم اس پر ایمان لے آئے بیشک وہ ہمارے پروردگار کی طرف سے برحق ہے اور ہم تو اس سے پہلے کے حکمبردار ہیں",
        "ان لوگوں کو دگنا بدلہ دیا جائے گا کیونکہ صبر کرتے رہے ہیں اور بھلائی کے ساتھ برائی کو دور کرتے ہیں اور جو (مال) ہم نے اُن کو دیا ہے اس میں سے خرچ کرتے ہیں",
        "اور جب بیہودہ بات سنتے ہیں تو اس سے منہ پھیر لیتے ہیں اور کہتے ہیں کہ ہم کو ہمارے اعمال اور تم کو تمہارے اعمال۔ تم کو سلام۔ ہم جاہلوں کے خواستگار نہیں ہیں",
        "(اے محمدﷺ) تم جس کو دوست رکھتے ہو اُسے ہدایت نہیں کر سکتے بلکہ خدا ہی جس کو چاہتا ہے ہدایت کرتا ہے اور وہ ہدایت پانیوالوں کو خوب جانتا ہے",
        "اور کہتے ہیں کہ اگر ہم تمہارے ساتھ ہدایت کی پیروی کریں تو اپنے ملک سے اُچک لئے جائیں۔ کیا ہم نے اُن کو حرم میں جو امن کا مقام ہے جگہ نہیں دی۔ جہاں ہر قسم کے میوے پہنچائے جاتے ہیں (اور یہ) رزق ہماری طرف سے ہے لیکن ان میں سے اکثر نہیں جانتے",
        "اور ہم نے بہت سی بستیوں کو ہلاک کر ڈالا جو اپنی (فراخی) معیشت میں اترا رہے تھے۔ سو یہ اُن کے مکانات ہیں جو اُن کے بعد آباد ہی نہیں ہوئے مگر بہت کم۔ اور اُن کے پیچھے ہم ہی اُن کے وارث ہوئے",
        "اور تمہارا پروردگار بستیوں کو ہلاک نہیں کیا کرتا۔ جب تک اُن کے بڑے شہر میں پیغمبر نہ بھیج لے جو اُن کو ہماری آیتیں پڑھ پڑھ کر سنائے اور ہم بستیوں کو ہلاک نہیں کیا کرتے مگر اس حالت میں کہ وہاں کے باشندے ظالم ہوں",
        "اور جو چیز تم کو دی گئی ہے وہ دنیا کی زندگی کا فائدہ اور اس کی زینت ہے۔ اور جو خدا کے پاس ہے وہ بہتر اور باقی رہنے والی ہے۔ کیا تم سمجھتے نہیں؟",
        "بھلا جس شخص سے ہم نے نیک وعدہ کیا اور اُس نے اُسے حاصل کرلیا تو کیا وہ اس شخص کا سا ہے جس کو ہم نے دنیا کی زندگی کے فائدے سے بہرہ مند کیا پھر وہ قیامت کے روز ان لوگوں میں ہو جو (ہمارے روبرو) حاضر کئے جائیں گے",
        "اور جس روز خدا اُن کو پکارے گا اور کہے گا کہ میرے وہ شریک کہاں ہیں جن کا تمہیں دعویٰ تھا",
        "(تو) جن لوگوں پر (عذاب کا) حکم ثابت ہوچکا ہوگا وہ کہیں گے کہ ہمارے پروردگار یہ وہ لوگ ہیں جن کو ہم نے گمراہ کیا تھا۔ اور جس طرح ہم خود گمراہ ہوئے تھے اسی طرح اُن کو گمراہ کیا تھا (اب) ہم تیری طرف (متوجہ ہوکر) اُن سے بیزار ہوتے ہیں یہ ہمیں نہیں پوجتے تھے",
        "اور کہا جائے گا کہ اپنے شریکوں کو بلاؤ۔ تو وہ اُن کو پکاریں گے اور وہ اُن کو جواب نہ دے سکیں گے اور (جب) عذاب کو دیکھ لیں گے (تو تمنا کریں گے کہ) کاش وہ ہدایت یاب ہوتے",
        "اور جس روز خدا اُن کو پکارے گا اور کہے گا کہ تم نے پیغمبروں کو کیا جواب دیا",
        "تو وہ اس روز خبروں سے اندھے ہو جائیں گے، اور آپس میں کچھ بھی پوچھ نہ سکیں گے",
        "لیکن جس نے توبہ کی اور ایمان لایا اور عمل نیک کئے تو اُمید ہے کہ وہ نجات پانے والوں میں ہو",
        "اور تمہارا پروردگار جو چاہتا ہے پیدا کرتا ہے اور (جسے چاہتا ہے) برگزیدہ کرلیتا ہے۔ ان کو اس کا اختیار نہیں ہے۔ یہ جو شرک کرتے ہیں خدا اس سے پاک وبالاتر ہے",
        "اور ان کے سینے جو کچھ مخفی کرتے اور جو یہ ظاہر کرتے ہیں تمہارا پروردگار اس کو جانتا ہے",
        "اور وہی خدا ہے اس کے سوا کوئی معبود نہیں دنیا اور آخرت میں اُسی کی تعریف ہے اور اُسی کا حکم اور اسی کی طرف تم لوٹائے جاؤ گے",
        "کہو بھلا دیکھو تو اگر خدا تم پر ہمیشہ قیامت کے دن تک رات (کی تاریکی) کئے رہے تو خدا کے سوا کون معبود ہے ہے جو تم کو روشنی لا دے تو کیا تم سنتے نہیں؟",
        "کہو تو بھلا دیکھو تو اگر خدا تم پر ہمیشہ قیامت تک دن کئے رہے تو خدا کے سوا کون معبود ہے کہ تم کو رات لا دے جس میں تم آرام کرو۔ تو کیا تم دیکھتے نہیں؟",
        "اور اس نے اپنی رحمت سے تمہارے لئے رات کو اور دن کو بنایا تاکہ تم اس میں آرام کرو اور اس میں اس کا فضل تلاش کرو اور تاکہ شکر کرو",
        "اور جس دن وہ اُن کو پکارے گا اور کہے گا کہ میرے وہ شریک جن کا تمہیں دعویٰ تھا کہاں گئے؟",
        "اور ہم ہر ایک اُمت میں سے گواہ نکال لیں گے پھر کہیں گے کہ اپنی دلیل پیش کرو تو وہ جان لیں گے کہ سچ بات خدا کی ہے اور جو کچھ وہ افتراء کیا کرتے تھے ان سے جاتا رہے گا",
        "قارون موسٰی کی قوم میں سے تھا اور ان پر تعدّی کرتا تھا۔ اور ہم نے اس کو اتنے خزانے دیئے تھے کہ اُن کی کنجیاں ایک طاقتور جماعت کو اُٹھانی مشکل ہوتیں جب اس سے اس کی قوم نے کہا کہ اترائیے مت۔ کہ خدا اترانے والوں کو پسند نہیں کرتا",
        "اور جو (مال) تم کو خدا نے عطا فرمایا ہے اس سے آخرت کی بھلائی طلب کیجئے اور دنیا سے اپنا حصہ نہ بھلائیے اور جیسی خدا نے تم سے بھلائی کی ہے (ویسی) تم بھی (لوگوں سے) بھلائی کرو۔ اور ملک میں طالب فساد نہ ہو۔ کیونکہ خدا فساد کرنے والوں کو دوست نہیں رکھتا",
        "بولا کہ یہ (مال) مجھے میری دانش (کے زور) سے ملا ہے کیا اس کو معلوم نہیں کہ خدا نے اس سے پہلے بہت سی اُمتیں جو اس سے قوت میں بڑھ کر اور جمعیت میں بیشتر تھیں ہلاک کر ڈالی ہیں۔ اور گنہگاروں سے اُن کے گناہوں کے بارے میں پوچھا نہیں جائے گا",
        "تو (ایک روز) قارون (بڑی) آرائش (اور ٹھاٹھ) سے اپنی قوم کے سامنے نکلا۔ جو لوگ دنیا کی زندگی کے طالب تھے کہنے لگے کہ جیسا (مال ومتاع) قارون کو ملا ہے کاش ایسا ہی ہمیں بھی ملے۔ وہ تو بڑا ہی صاحب نصیب ہے",
        "اور جن لوگوں کو علم دیا گیا تھا وہ کہنے لگے کہ تم پر افسوس۔ مومنوں اور نیکوکاروں کے لئے (جو) ثواب خدا (کے ہاں تیار ہے وہ) کہیں بہتر ہے اور وہ صرف صبر کرنے والوں ہی کو ملے گا",
        "پس ہم نے قارون کو اور اس کے گھر کو زمین میں دھنسا دیا تو خدا کے سوا کوئی جماعت اس کی مددگار نہ ہوسکی۔ اور نہ وہ بدلہ لے سکا",
        "اور وہ لوگ جو کل اُس کے رتبے کی تمنا کرتے تھے صبح کو کہنے لگے ہائے شامت! خدا ہی تو اپنے بندوں میں سے جس کے لئے چاہتا ہے رزق فراخ کر دیتا ہے اور (جس کے لئے چاہتا ہے) تنگ کر دیتا ہے۔ اگر خدا ہم پر احسان نہ کرتا تو ہمیں بھی دھنسا دیتا۔ ہائے خرابی! کافر نجات نہیں پا سکتے",
        "وہ (جو) آخرت کا گھر (ہے) ہم نے اُسے اُن لوگوں کے لئے (تیار) کر رکھا ہے جو ملک میں ظلم اور فساد کا ارادہ نہیں رکھتے اور انجام (نیک) تو پرہیزگاروں ہی کا ہے",
        "جو شخص نیکی لے کر آئے گا اس کے لئے اس سے بہتر (صلہ موجود) ہے اور جو برائی لائے گا تو جن لوگوں نے برے کام کئے ان کو بدلہ بھی اسی طرح کا ملے گا جس طرح کے وہ کام کرتے تھے",
        "(اے پیغمبر) جس (خدا) نے تم پر قرآن (کے احکام) کو فرض کیا ہے وہ تمہیں بازگشت کی جگہ لوٹا دے گا۔ کہہ دو کہ میرا پروردگار اس شخص کو بھی خوب جانتا ہے جو ہدایت لےکر آیا اور (اس کو بھی) جو صریح گمراہی میں ہے",
        "اور تمہیں اُمید نہ تھی کہ تم پر کتاب نازل کی جائے گی۔ مگر تمہارے پروردگار کی مہربانی سے (نازل ہوئی) تو تم ہرگز کافروں کے مددگار نہ ہونا",
        "اور وہ تمہیں خدا کی آیتوں کی تبلیغ سے بعد اس کے کہ وہ تم پر نازل ہوچکی ہیں روک نہ دیں اور اپنے پروردگار کو پکارتے رہو اور مشرکوں میں ہرگز نہ ہو جیو",
        "اور خدا کے ساتھ کسی اور کو معبود (سمجھ کر) نہ پکارنا اس کے سوا کوئی معبود نہیں۔ اس کی ذات (پاک) کے سوا ہر چیز فنا ہونے والی ہے۔ اسی کا حکم ہے اور اسی کی طرف تم لوٹ کر جاؤ گے"
