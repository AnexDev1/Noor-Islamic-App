        "Alif-Lãm-Mĩm.",
        "This is the Book! There is no doubt about it—a guide for those mindful ˹of Allah˺",
        "who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and donate from what We have provided for them",
        "and who believe in what has been revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ and what was revealed before you, and have sure faith in the Hereafter.",
        "It is they who are ˹truly˺ guided by their Lord, and it is they who will be successful.",
        "As for those who persist in disbelief, it is the same whether you warn them or not—they will never believe.",
        "Allah has sealed their hearts and their hearing, and their sight is covered. They will suffer a tremendous punishment.",
        "And there are some who say, “We believe in Allah and the Last Day,” yet they are not ˹true˺ believers.",
        "They seek to deceive Allah and the believers, yet they only deceive themselves, but they fail to perceive it.",
        "There is sickness in their hearts, and Allah ˹only˺ lets their sickness increase. They will suffer a painful punishment for their lies.",
        "When they are told, “Do not spread corruption in the land,” they reply, “We are only peace-makers!”",
        "Indeed, it is they who are the corruptors, but they fail to perceive it.",
        "And when they are told, “Believe as others believe,” they reply, “Will we believe as the fools believe?” Indeed, it is they who are fools, but they do not know.",
        "When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But when alone with their evil associates they say, “We are definitely with you; we were only mocking.”",
        "Allah will throw their mockery back at them, leaving them to continue wandering blindly in their defiance.",
        "They are the ones who trade guidance for misguidance. But this trade is profitless, and they are not ˹rightly˺ guided.",
        "Their example is that of someone who kindles a fire, but when it lights up all around them, Allah takes away their light, leaving them in complete darkness—unable to see.",
        "They are ˹wilfully˺ deaf, dumb, and blind, so they will never return ˹to the Right Path˺.",
        "Or ˹those caught in˺ a rainstorm from the sky with darkness, thunder, and lightning. They press their fingers into their ears at the sound of every thunder-clap for fear of death. And Allah encompasses the disbelievers ˹by His might˺.",
        "It is as if the lightning were about to snatch away their sight. Whenever lightning strikes, they walk in its light, but when darkness covers them, they stand still. Had Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and sight. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
        "O humanity! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may become mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "˹He is the One˺ Who has made the earth a place of settlement for you and the sky a canopy; and sends down rain from the sky, causing fruits to grow as a provision for you. So do not knowingly set up equals to Allah ˹in worship˺.",
        "And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true.",
        "But if you are unable to do so—and you will never be able to do so—then fear the Fire fuelled with people and stones, which is prepared for the disbelievers.",
        "Give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to those who believe and do good that they will have Gardens under which rivers flow. Whenever provided with fruit, they will say, “This is what we were given before,” for they will be served fruit that looks similar ˹but tastes different˺. They will have pure spouses, and they will be there forever.",
        "Surely Allah does not shy away from using the parable of a mosquito or what is even smaller. As for the believers, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. And as for the disbelievers, they argue, “What does Allah mean by such a parable?” Through this ˹test˺, He leaves many to stray, and guides many. And He leaves none to stray except the rebellious—",
        "those who violate Allah’s covenant after it has been affirmed, break whatever ˹ties˺ Allah has ordered to be maintained, and spread corruption in the land. It is they who are the ˹true˺ losers.",
        "How can you deny Allah? You were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, and then to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned.",
        "He is the One Who created everything in the earth for you. Then He turned towards the heaven, forming it into seven heavens. And He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.",
        "˹Remember˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to place a successive ˹human˺ authority on earth.” They asked ˹Allah˺, “Will You place in it someone who will spread corruption there and shed blood while we glorify Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” Allah responded, “I know what you do not know.”",
        "He taught Adam the names of all things, then He presented them to the angels and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if what you say is true?”",
        "They replied, “Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. You are truly the All-Knowing, All-Wise.”",
        "Allah said, “O Adam! Inform them of their names.” Then when Adam did, Allah said, “Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?”",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who refused and acted arrogantly, becoming unfaithful.",
        "We cautioned, “O Adam! Live with your wife in Paradise and eat as freely as you please, but do not approach this tree, or else you will be wrongdoers.”",
        "But Satan deceived them—leading to their fall from the ˹blissful˺ state they were in, and We said, “Descend from the heavens ˹to the earth˺ as enemies to each other. You will find in the earth a residence and provision for your appointed stay.”",
        "Then Adam was inspired with words ˹of prayer˺ by his Lord, so He accepted his repentance. Surely He is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.",
        "We said, “Descend all of you! Then when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows it, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
        "But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.”",
        "O children of Israel! Remember My favours upon you. Fulfil your covenant and I will fulfil Mine, and stand in awe of Me ˹alone˺.",
        "Believe in My revelations which confirm your Scriptures. Do not be the first to deny them or trade them for a fleeting gain. And be mindful of Me.",
        "Do not mix truth with falsehood or hide the truth knowingly.",
        "Establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and bow down with those who bow down.",
        "Do you preach righteousness and fail to practice it yourselves, although you read the Scripture? Do you not understand?",
        "And seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, it is a burden except for the humble—",
        "those who are certain that they will meet their Lord and to Him they will return.",
        "O Children of Israel! Remember ˹all˺ the favours I granted you and how I honoured you above the others.",
        "Guard yourselves against the Day on which no soul will be of help to another. No intercession will be accepted, no ransom taken, and no help will be given.",
        "˹Remember˺ how We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from your Lord.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We parted the sea, rescued you, and drowned Pharaoh’s people before your very eyes.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We appointed forty nights for Moses, then you worshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully.",
        "Even then We ˹still˺ forgave you so perhaps you would be grateful.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We gave Moses the Scripture—the standard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺ that perhaps you would be ˹rightly˺ guided.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “O my people! Surely you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf, so turn in repentance to your Creator and execute ˹the calf-worshippers among˺ yourselves. That is best for you in the sight of your Creator.” Then He accepted your repentance. Surely He is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when you said, “O Moses! We will never believe you until we see Allah with our own eyes,” so a thunderbolt struck you while you were looking on.",
        "Then We brought you back to life after your death, so that perhaps you would be grateful.",
        "And ˹remember when˺ We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, ˹saying˺, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” The evildoers ˹certainly˺ did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We said, “Enter this city and eat freely from wherever you please; enter the gate with humility, saying, ‘Absolve us.’ We will forgive your sins and multiply the reward for the good-doers.”",
        "But the wrongdoers changed the words they were commanded to say. So We sent down a punishment from the heavens upon them for their rebelliousness.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said, “Strike the rock with your staff.” Then twelve springs gushed out, ˹and˺ each tribe knew its drinking place. ˹We then said,˺ “Eat and drink of Allah’s provisions, and do not go about spreading corruption in the land.”",
        "And ˹remember˺ when you said, “O Moses! We cannot endure the same meal ˹every day˺. So ˹just˺ call upon your Lord on our behalf, He will bring forth for us some of what the earth produces of herbs, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.” Moses scolded ˹them˺, “Do you exchange what is better for what is worse? ˹You can˺ go down to any village and you will find what you have asked for.” They were stricken with disgrace and misery, and they invited the displeasure of Allah for rejecting Allah’s signs and unjustly killing the prophets. This is ˹a fair reward˺ for their disobedience and violations.",
        "Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from you and raised the mountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and observe its teachings so perhaps you will become mindful ˹of Allah˺.”",
        "Yet you turned away afterwards. Had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, you would have certainly been of the losers.",
        "You are already aware of those of you who broke the Sabbath. We said to them, “Be disgraced apes!”",
        "So We made their fate an example to present and future generations, and a lesson to the God-fearing.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when Moses said to his people, “Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow.” They replied, “Are you mocking us?” Moses responded, “I seek refuge in Allah from acting foolishly!”",
        "They said, “Call upon your Lord to clarify for us what type ˹of cow˺ it should be!” He replied, “Allah says, ‘The cow should neither be old nor young but in between. So do as you are commanded!’”",
        "They said, “Call upon your Lord to specify for us its colour.” He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should be a bright yellow cow—pleasant to see.’”",
        "Again they said, “Call upon your Lord so that He may make clear to us which cow, for all cows look the same to us. Then, Allah willing, we will be guided ˹to the right one˺.”",
        "He replied, “Allah says, ‘It should have been used neither to till the soil nor water the fields; wholesome and without blemish.’” They said, “Now you have come with the truth.” Yet they still slaughtered it hesitantly!",
        "˹This is˺ when a man was killed and you disputed who the killer was, but Allah revealed what you concealed.",
        "So We instructed, “Strike the dead body with a piece of the cow.” This is how ˹easily˺ Allah brings the dead to life, showing you His signs so that you may understand.",
        "Even then your hearts became hardened like a rock or even harder, for some rocks gush rivers; others split, spilling water; while others are humbled in awe of Allah. And Allah is never unaware of what you do.",
        "Do you ˹believers still˺ expect them to be true to you, though a group of them would hear the word of Allah then knowingly corrupt it after understanding it?",
        "When they meet the believers they say, “We believe.” But in private they say ˹to each other˺, “Will you disclose to the believers the knowledge Allah has revealed to you, so that they may use it against you before your Lord? Do you not understand?”",
        "Do they not know that Allah is aware of what they conceal and what they reveal?",
        "And among them are the illiterate who know nothing about the Scripture except lies, and ˹so˺ they ˹wishfully˺ speculate.",
        "So woe to those who distort the Scripture with their own hands then say, “This is from Allah”—seeking a fleeting gain! So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they have earned.",
        "˹Some of˺ the Jews claim, “The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Have you taken a pledge from Allah—for Allah never breaks His word—or are you ˹just˺ saying about Allah what you do not know?”",
        "But no! Those who commit evil and are engrossed in sin will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.",
        "And those who believe and do good will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We took a covenant from the children of Israel ˹stating˺, “Worship none but Allah; be kind to parents, relatives, orphans and the needy; speak kindly to people; establish prayer; and pay alms-tax.” But you ˹Israelites˺ turned away—except for a few of you—and were indifferent.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We took your covenant that you would neither shed each other’s blood nor expel each other from their homes, you gave your pledge and bore witness.",
        "But here you are, killing each other and expelling some of your people from their homes, aiding one another in sin and aggression; and when those ˹expelled˺ come to you as captives, you still ransom them—though expelling them was unlawful for you. Do you believe in some of the Scripture and reject the rest? Is there any reward for those who do so among you other than disgrace in this worldly life and being subjected to the harshest punishment on the Day of Judgment? For Allah is never unaware of what you do.",
        "These are the ones who trade the Hereafter for the life of this world. So their punishment will not be reduced, nor will they be helped.",
        "Indeed, We gave Moses the Book and sent after him successive messengers. And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit. Why is it that every time a messenger comes to you ˹Israelites˺ with something you do not like, you become arrogant, rejecting some and killing others?",
        "They say, “Our hearts are unreceptive!” In fact, Allah has condemned them for their disbelief. They have but little faith.",
        "Although they used to pray for victory ˹by means of the Prophet˺ over the polytheists, when there came to them a Book from Allah which they recognized, confirming the Scripture they had ˹in their hands˺, they rejected it. So may Allah’s condemnation be upon the disbelievers.",
        "Miserable is the price they have sold their souls for—denying Allah’s revelation and resenting Allah for granting His grace to whoever He wills of His servants! They have earned wrath upon wrath. And such disbelievers will suffer a humiliating punishment.",
        "When it is said to them: “Believe in what Allah has revealed,” they reply, “We only believe in what was sent down to us,” and they deny what came afterwards, though it is the truth confirming their own Scriptures! Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Why then did you kill Allah’s prophets before, if you are ˹truly˺ believers?”",
        "Indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs, then you worshipped the calf in his absence, acting wrongfully.",
        "And when We took your covenant and raised the mountain above you ˹saying˺, “Hold firmly to that ˹Scripture˺ which We have given you and obey,” they answered, “We hear and disobey.” The love of the calf was rooted in their hearts because of their disbelief. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “How evil is what your ˹so-called˺ belief prompts you to do, if you ˹actually˺ believe ˹in the Torah˺!”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter with Allah is exclusively for you ˹Israelites˺ out of all humanity, then wish for death if what you say is true!”",
        "But they will never wish for that because of what their hands have done. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers.",
        "You will surely find them clinging to life more eagerly than any other people, even more than polytheists. Each one of them wishes to live a thousand years. But even if they were to live that long, it would not save them from the punishment. And Allah is All-Seeing of what they do.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Whoever is an enemy of Gabriel should know that he revealed this ˹Quran˺ to your heart by Allah’s Will, confirming what came before it—a guide and good news for the believers.”",
        "Whoever is an enemy of Allah, His angels, His messengers, Gabriel, and Michael, then ˹let them know that˺ Allah is certainly the enemy of the disbelievers.",
        "Indeed, We have sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ clear revelations. ˹But˺ none will deny them except the rebellious.",
        "Why is it that every time they make a covenant, a group of them casts it aside? In fact, most of them do not believe.",
        "Now, when a messenger from Allah has come to them—confirming their own Scriptures—some of the People of the Book cast the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.",
        "They ˹instead˺ followed the magic promoted by the devils during the reign of Solomon. Never did Solomon disbelieve, rather the devils disbelieved. They taught magic to the people, along with what had been revealed to the two angels, Hârût and Mârût, in Babylon. The two angels never taught anyone without saying, “We are only a test ˹for you˺, so do not abandon ˹your˺ faith.” Yet people learned ˹magic˺ that caused a rift ˹even˺ between husband and wife; although their magic could not harm anyone except by Allah’s Will. They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them—although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would have no share in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed was the price for which they sold their souls, if only they knew!",
        "If only they were faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, there would have been a better reward from Allah, if only they knew!",
        "O believers! Do not say, “Râ’ina.” [Herd us!] But say, “Unẓurna,” [Tend to us!] and listen ˹attentively˺. And the disbelievers will suffer a painful punishment.",
        "The disbelievers from the People of the Book and the polytheists would not want you to receive any blessing from your Lord, but Allah selects whoever He wills for His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty.",
        "If We ever abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We replace it with a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of everything?",
        "Do you not know that the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs ˹only˺ to Allah, and you have no guardian or helper besides Allah?",
        "Or do you ˹believers˺ intend to ask of your Messenger as Moses was asked before? But whoever trades belief for disbelief has truly strayed from the Right Way.",
        "Many among the People of the Book wish they could turn you ˹believers˺ back to disbelief because of their envy, after the truth has been made clear to them. Pardon and bear with them until Allah delivers His decision. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
        "Establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will ˹certainly˺ find ˹its reward˺ with Allah. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",
        "The Jews and Christians each claim that none will enter Paradise except those of their own faith. These are their desires. Reply, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Show ˹me˺ your proof if what you say is true.”",
        "But no! Whoever submits themselves to Allah and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
        "The Jews say, “The Christians have nothing to stand on” and the Christians say, “The Jews have nothing to stand on,” although both recite the Scriptures. And those ˹pagans˺ who have no knowledge say the same ˹about people of faith˺. Surely Allah will judge between them on the Day of Judgment regarding their dispute.",
        "Who does more wrong than those who prevent Allah’s Name from being mentioned in His places of worship and strive to destroy them? Such people have no right to enter these places except with fear. For them is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter.",
        "To Allah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn you are facing ˹towards˺ Allah. Surely Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.",
        "They say, “Allah has offspring.” Glory be to Him! In fact, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth—all are subject to His Will.",
        "˹He is˺ the Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decrees a matter, He simply tells it, “Be!” And it is!",
        "Those who have no knowledge say, “If only Allah would speak to us or a sign would come to us!” The same was said by those who came before. Their hearts are all alike. Indeed, We have made the signs clear for people of sure faith.",
        "We have surely sent you with the truth ˹O Prophet˺ as a deliverer of good news and a warner. And you will not be accountable for the residents of the Hellfire.",
        "Never will the Jews or Christians be pleased with you, until you follow their faith. Say, “Allah’s guidance is the only ˹true˺ guidance.” And if you were to follow their desires after ˹all˺ the knowledge that has come to you, there would be none to protect or help you against Allah.",
        "Those We have given the Book follow it as it should be followed. It is they who ˹truly˺ believe in it. As for those who reject it, it is they who are the losers.",
        "O Children of Israel! Remember My favours upon you and how I honoured you above the others.",
        "And guard yourselves against the Day when no soul will be of any help to another. No ransom will be taken, no intercession accepted, and no help will be given.",
        "˹Remember˺ when Abraham was tested by his Lord with ˹certain˺ commandments, which he fulfilled. Allah said, “I will certainly make you into a role model for the people.” Abraham asked, “What about my offspring?” Allah replied, “My covenant is not extended to the wrongdoers.”",
        "And ˹remember˺ when We made the Sacred House a centre and a sanctuary for the people ˹saying˺, “˹You may˺ take the standing-place of Abraham as a site of prayer.” And We entrusted Abraham and Ishmael to purify My House for those who circle it, who meditate in it, and who bow and prostrate themselves ˹in prayer˺.",
        "And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city ˹of Mecca˺ secure and provide fruits to its people—those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” He answered, “As for those who disbelieve, I will let them enjoy themselves for a little while, then I will condemn them to the torment of the Fire. What an evil destination!”",
        "And ˹remember˺ when Abraham raised the foundation of the House with Ishmael, ˹both praying,˺ “Our Lord! Accept ˹this˺ from us. You are indeed the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "Our Lord! Make us both ˹fully˺ submit to You and from our descendants a nation that will submit to you. Show us our rituals, and turn to us in grace. You are truly the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.",
        "Our Lord! Raise from among them a messenger who will recite to them Your revelations, teach them the Book and wisdom, and purify them. Indeed, You ˹alone˺ are the Almighty, All-Wise.”",
        "And who would reject the faith of Abraham except a fool! We certainly chose him in this life, and in the Hereafter he will surely be among the righteous.",
        "When his Lord ordered him, “Submit ˹to My Will˺,” he responded, “I submit to the Lord of all worlds.”",
        "This was the advice of Abraham—as well as Jacob—to his children, ˹saying˺, “Indeed, Allah has chosen for you this faith; so do not die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission.”",
        "Or did you witness when death came to Jacob? He asked his children, “Who will you worship after my passing?” They replied, “We will ˹continue to˺ worship your God, the God of your forefathers—Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac—the One God. And to Him we ˹all˺ submit.”",
        "That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be accountable for what they have done.",
        "The Jews and Christians each say, “Follow our faith to be ˹rightly˺ guided.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “No! We follow the faith of Abraham, the upright—who was not a polytheist.”",
        "Say, ˹O believers,˺ “We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us; and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants; and what was given to Moses, Jesus, and other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them. And to Allah we all submit.”",
        "So if they believe in what you believe, then they will indeed be ˹rightly˺ guided. But if they turn away, they are simply opposed ˹to the truth˺. But Allah will spare you their evil. For He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "This is the ˹natural˺ Way of Allah. And who is better than Allah in ordaining a way? And we worship ˹none but˺ Him.",
        "Say, “Would you dispute with us about Allah, while He is our Lord and your Lord? We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. And we are devoted to Him ˹alone˺.",
        "Do you claim that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his descendants were all Jews or Christians?” Say, “Who is more knowledgeable: you or Allah?” Who does more wrong than those who hide the testimony they received from Allah? And Allah is never unaware of what you do.",
        "That was a community that had already gone before. For them is what they earned and for you is what you have earned. And you will not be accountable for what they have done.",
        "The foolish among the people will ask, “Why did they turn away from the direction of prayer they used to face?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The east and west belong ˹only˺ to Allah. He guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.”",
        "And so We have made you ˹believers˺ an upright community so that you may be witnesses over humanity and that the Messenger may be a witness over you. We assigned your former direction of prayer only to distinguish those who would remain faithful to the Messenger from those who would lose faith. It was certainly a difficult test except for those ˹rightly˺ guided by Allah. And Allah would never discount your ˹previous acts of˺ faith. Surely Allah is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity.",
        "Indeed, We see you ˹O Prophet˺ turning your face towards heaven. Now We will make you turn towards a direction ˹of prayer˺ that will please you. So turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque ˹in Mecca˺—wherever you are, turn your faces towards it. Those who were given the Scripture certainly know this to be the truth from their Lord. And Allah is never unaware of what they do.",
        "Even if you were to bring every proof to the People of the Book, they would not accept your direction ˹of prayer˺, nor would you accept theirs; nor would any of them accept the direction ˹of prayer˺ of another. And if you were to follow their desires after ˹all˺ the knowledge that has come to you, then you would certainly be one of the wrongdoers.",
        "Those We have given the Scripture recognize this ˹Prophet˺ as they recognize their own children. Yet a group of them hides the truth knowingly.",
        "˹This is˺ the truth from your Lord, so do not ever be one of those who doubt.",
        "Everyone turns to their own direction ˹of prayer˺. So compete with one another in doing good. Wherever you are, Allah will bring you all together ˹for judgment˺. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
        "Wherever you are ˹O Prophet˺, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. This is certainly the truth from your Lord. And Allah is never unaware of what you ˹all˺ do.",
        "Wherever you are ˹O Prophet˺, turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you ˹believers˺ are, face towards it, so that people will have no argument against you, except the wrongdoers among them. Do not fear them; fear Me, so that I may ˹continue to˺ perfect My favour upon you and so you may be ˹rightly˺ guided.",
        "Since We have sent you a messenger from among yourselves—reciting to you Our revelations, purifying you, teaching you the Book and wisdom, and teaching you what you never knew—",
        "remember Me; I will remember you. And thank Me, and never be ungrateful.",
        "O believers! Seek comfort in patience and prayer. Allah is truly with those who are patient.",
        "Never say that those martyred in the cause of Allah are dead—in fact, they are alive! But you do not perceive it.",
        "We will certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property, life, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endure—",
        "who, when faced with a disaster, say, “Surely to Allah we belong and to Him we will ˹all˺ return.”",
        "They are the ones who will receive Allah’s blessings and mercy. And it is they who are ˹rightly˺ guided.",
        "Indeed, ˹the hills of˺ Ṣafa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever performs the pilgrimage or minor pilgrimage, let them walk between ˹the two hills˺. And whoever does good willingly, Allah is truly Appreciative, All-Knowing.",
        "Those who hide the clear proofs and guidance that We have revealed—after We made it clear for humanity in the Book—will be condemned by Allah and ˹all˺ those who condemn.",
        "As for those who repent, mend their ways, and let the truth be known, they are the ones to whom I will turn ˹in forgiveness˺, for I am the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.",
        "Surely those who disbelieve and die as disbelievers are condemned by Allah, the angels, and all of humanity.",
        "They will be in Hell forever. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be delayed ˹from it˺.",
        "Your God is ˹only˺ One God. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful.",
        "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth; the alternation of the day and the night; the ships that sail the sea for the benefit of humanity; the rain sent down by Allah from the skies, reviving the earth after its death; the scattering of all kinds of creatures throughout; the shifting of the winds; and the clouds drifting between the heavens and the earth—˹in all of this˺ are surely signs for people of understanding.",
        "Still there are some who take others as Allah’s equal—they love them as they should love Allah—but the ˹true˺ believers love Allah even more. If only the wrongdoers could see the ˹horrible˺ punishment ˹awaiting them˺, they would certainly realize that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is indeed severe in punishment.",
        "˹Consider the Day˺ when those who misled others will disown their followers—when they face the torment—and the bonds that united them will be cut off.",
        "The ˹misled˺ followers will cry, “If only we could have a second chance, we would disown them as they disowned us.” And so Allah will make them remorseful of their misdeeds. And they will never ˹be able to˺ leave the Fire.",
        "O humanity! Eat from what is lawful and good on the earth and do not follow Satan’s footsteps. He is truly your sworn enemy.",
        "He only incites you to commit evil and indecency, and to claim against Allah what you do not know.",
        "When it is said to them, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” they reply, “No! We ˹only˺ follow what we found our forefathers practicing.” ˹Would they still do so,˺ even if their forefathers had ˹absolutely˺ no understanding or guidance?",
        "The example of the disbelievers ˹not responding to the Messenger’s warning˺ is like a flock not comprehending the calls and cries of the shepherd. ˹They are wilfully˺ deaf, dumb and blind so they have no understanding.",
        "O believers! Eat from the good things We have provided for you. And give thanks to Allah if you ˹truly˺ worship Him ˹alone˺.",
        "He has only forbidden you ˹to eat˺ carrion, blood, swine, and what is slaughtered in the name of any other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need—they will not be sinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "Indeed, those who hide Allah’s revelations, trading them for a fleeting gain consume nothing but fire into their bellies. Allah will neither speak to them on the Day of Judgment, nor will He purify them. And they will suffer a painful punishment.",
        "They are the ones who trade guidance for misguidance and forgiveness for punishment. How persistent are they in pursuit of the Fire!",
        "That is because Allah has revealed the Book in truth. And surely those who differ regarding it are totally engrossed in opposition.",
        "Righteousness is not in turning your faces towards the east or the west. Rather, the righteous are those who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Books, and the prophets; who give charity out of their cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the poor, ˹needy˺ travellers, beggars, and for freeing captives; who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and keep the pledges they make; and who are patient in times of suffering, adversity, and in ˹the heat of˺ battle. It is they who are true ˹in faith˺, and it is they who are mindful ˹of Allah˺.",
        "O believers! ˹The law of˺ retaliation is set for you in cases of murder—a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if the offender is pardoned by the victim’s guardian, then blood-money should be decided fairly and payment should be made courteously. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses after that will suffer a painful punishment.",
        "There is ˹security of˺ life for you in ˹the law of˺ retaliation, O  people of reason, so that you may become mindful ˹of Allah˺.",
        "It is prescribed that when death approaches any of you—if they leave something of value—a will should be made in favour of parents and immediate family with fairness. ˹This is˺ an obligation on those who are mindful ˹of Allah˺.",
        "But whoever changes the will after hearing it, the blame will only be on those who made the change. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "Whoever suspects an error or an injustice in the will and brings about a ˹fair˺ settlement among the parties will not be sinful. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "O believers! Fasting is prescribed for you—as it was for those before you—so perhaps you will become mindful ˹of Allah˺.",
        "˹Fast a˺ prescribed number of days. But whoever of you is ill or on a journey, then ˹let them fast˺ an equal number of days ˹after Ramaḍân˺. For those who can only fast with extreme difficulty, compensation can be made by feeding a needy person ˹for every day not fasted˺. But whoever volunteers to give more, it is better for them. And to fast is better for you, if only you knew.",
        "Ramaḍân is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. But whoever is ill or on a journey, then ˹let them fast˺ an equal number of days ˹after Ramaḍân˺. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful.",
        "When My servants ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about Me: I am truly near. I respond to one’s prayer when they call upon Me. So let them respond ˹with obedience˺ to Me and believe in Me, perhaps they will be guided ˹to the Right Way˺.",
        "It has been made permissible for you to be intimate with your wives during the nights preceding the fast. Your spouses are a garment for you as you are for them. Allah knows that you were deceiving yourselves. So He has accepted your repentance and pardoned you. So now you may be intimate with them and seek what Allah has prescribed for you. ˹You may˺ eat and drink until you see the light of dawn breaking the darkness of night, then complete the fast until nightfall. Do not be intimate with your spouses while you are meditating in the mosques. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not exceed them. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to people, so they may become mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "Do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly, nor deliberately bribe authorities in order to devour a portion of others’ property, knowing that it is a sin.",
        "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about the phases of the moon. Say, “They are a means for people to determine time and pilgrimage.” Righteousness is not in entering your houses from the back doors. Rather, righteousness is to be mindful ˹of Allah˺. So enter your homes through their ˹proper˺ doors, and be mindful of Allah so you may be successful.",
        "Fight in the cause of Allah ˹only˺ against those who wage war against you, but do not exceed the limits. Allah does not like transgressors.",
        "Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. For persecution is far worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight them—that is the reward of the disbelievers.",
        "But if they cease, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "Fight against them ˹if they persecute you˺ until there is no more persecution, and ˹your˺ devotion will be to Allah ˹alone˺. If they stop ˹persecuting you˺, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors.",
        "˹There will be retaliation in˺ a sacred month for ˹an offence in˺ a sacred month, and all violations will bring about retaliation. So, if anyone attacks you, retaliate in the same manner. ˹But˺ be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is with those mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "Spend in the cause of Allah and do not let your own hands throw you into destruction ˹by withholding˺. And do good, for Allah certainly loves the good-doers.",
        "Complete the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage for Allah. But if prevented ˹from proceeding˺, then ˹offer˺ whatever sacrificial animals you can afford. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal reaches its destination. But if any of you is ill or has a scalp ailment ˹requiring shaving˺, then compensate either by fasting, charity, or a sacrificial offering. In times of peace, you may combine the pilgrimage and minor pilgrimage then make the sacrificial offering you can afford. Whoever cannot afford that ˹offering˺, let them fast three days during pilgrimage and seven after returning ˹home˺—completing ten. These offerings are for those who do not live near the Sacred House. And be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is severe in punishment.",
        "˹Commitment to˺ pilgrimage is made in appointed months. Whoever commits to ˹performing˺ pilgrimage, let them stay away from intimate relations, foul language, and arguments during pilgrimage. Whatever good you do, Allah ˹fully˺ knows of it. Take ˹necessary˺ provisions ˹for the journey˺—surely the best provision is righteousness. And be mindful of Me, O  people of reason!",
        "There is no blame on you for seeking the bounty of your Lord ˹during this journey˺. When you return from ’Arafât, praise Allah near the sacred place and praise Him for having guided you, for surely before this ˹guidance˺ you were astray.",

        "When you have fulfilled your sacred rites, praise Allah as you used to praise your forefathers ˹before Islam˺, or even more passionately. There are some who say, “Our Lord! Grant us ˹Your bounties˺ in this world,” but they will have no share in the Hereafter.",

        "Humanity had once been one community ˹of believers before they lost faith˺. Then Allah raised prophets as deliverers of good news and as warners, and revealed to them the Scriptures in truth to judge among people regarding their disputes. And no one disputed the Scriptures except the very people who received them after clear proofs had come to them—out of jealousy. Then Allah, by His grace, has guided the believers to the truth regarding those disputes. And Allah guides whoever He wills to the Straight Path.",
        "Do you think you will be admitted into Paradise without being tested like those before you? They were afflicted with suffering and adversity and were so ˹violently˺ shaken that ˹even˺ the Messenger and the believers with him cried out, “When will Allah’s help come?” Indeed, Allah’s help is ˹always˺ near.",
        "They ask you ˹O Prophet in˺ what ˹way˺ they should donate. Say, “Whatever donations you give are for parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, and ˹needy˺ travellers. Whatever good you do is certainly well known to Allah.”",

But hindering ˹others˺ from the Path of Allah, rejecting Him, and expelling the worshippers from the Sacred Mosque is ˹a˺ greater ˹sin˺ in the sight of Allah. For persecution is far worse than killing. And they will not stop fighting you until they turn you away from your faith—if they can. And whoever among you renounces their own faith and dies a disbeliever, their deeds will become void in this life and in the Hereafter. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.”",

Say, “There is great evil in both, as well as some benefit for people—but the evil outweighs the benefit.” They ˹also˺ ask you ˹O Prophet˺ what they should donate. Say, “Whatever you can spare.” This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you ˹believers˺, so perhaps you may reflect",
        "upon this world and the Hereafter. And they ask you ˹O Prophet˺ concerning orphans. Say, “Improving their condition is best.

They invite ˹you˺ to the Fire while Allah invites ˹you˺ to Paradise and forgiveness by His grace. He makes His revelations clear to the people so perhaps they will be mindful.",
        "They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ about menstruation. Say, “Beware of its harm! So keep away, and do not have intercourse with your wives during their monthly cycles until they are purified. When they purify themselves, then you may approach them in the manner specified by Allah. Surely Allah loves those who always turn to Him in repentance and those who purify themselves.”",

        "But if they settle on divorce, then Allah is indeed All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "Divorced women must wait three monthly cycles ˹before they can re-marry˺. It is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, if they ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands reserve the right to take them back within that period if they desire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those of men equitably, although men have a degree ˹of responsibility˺ above them. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
        "Divorce may be retracted twice, then the husband must retain ˹his wife˺ with honour or separate ˹from her˺ with grace. It is not lawful for husbands to take back anything of the dowry given to their wives, unless the couple fears not being able to keep within the limits of Allah. So if you fear they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah, there is no blame if the wife compensates the husband to obtain divorce. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.",
        "So if a husband divorces his wife ˹three times˺, then it is not lawful for him to remarry her until after she has married another man and then is divorced. Then it is permissible for them to reunite, as long as they feel they are able to maintain the limits of Allah. These are the limits set by Allah, which He makes clear for people of knowledge.",
        "When you divorce women and they have ˹almost˺ reached the end of their waiting period, either retain them honourably or let them go honourably. But do not retain them ˹only˺ to harm them ˹or˺ to take advantage ˹of them˺. Whoever does that surely wrongs his own soul. Do not take Allah’s revelations lightly. Remember Allah’s favours upon you as well as the Book and wisdom He has sent down for your guidance. Be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.",
        "When you have divorced women and they have reached the end of their waiting period, do not prevent them from re-marrying their ex-husbands if they come to an honourable agreement. This is enjoined on whoever has faith in Allah and the Last Day. This is purer and more dignifying for you. Allah knows and you do not know.",
        "˹Divorced˺ mothers will breastfeed their offspring for two whole years, for those who wish to complete the nursing ˹of their child˺. The child’s father will provide reasonable maintenance and clothing for the mother ˹during that period˺. No one will be charged with more than they can bear. No mother or father should be made to suffer for their child. The ˹father’s˺ heirs are under the same obligation. But if both sides decide—after mutual consultation and consent—to wean a child, then there is no blame on them. If you decide to have your children nursed by a wet-nurse, it is permissible as long as you pay fairly. Be mindful of Allah, and know that Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",
        "As for those of you who die and leave widows behind, let them observe a waiting period of four months and ten days.

But do not make a secret commitment with them—you can only show interest in them appropriately. Do not commit to the bond of marriage until the waiting period expires. Know that Allah is aware of what is in your hearts, so beware of Him. And know that Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.",
        "There is no blame if you divorce women before the marriage is consummated or the dowry is settled. But give them a ˹suitable˺ compensation—the rich according to his means and the poor according to his. A reasonable compensation is an obligation on the good-doers.",
        "And if you divorce them before consummating the marriage but after deciding on a dowry, pay half of the dowry, unless the wife graciously waives it or the husband graciously pays in full. Graciousness is closer to righteousness. And do not forget kindness among yourselves. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",
        "Observe the ˹five obligatory˺ prayers—especially the middle prayer—and stand in true devotion to Allah.",

They said to one of their prophets, “Appoint for us a king, ˹and˺ we will fight in the cause of Allah.” He said, “Are you not going to cower if ordered to fight?” They replied, “How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, while we were driven out of our homes and ˹separated from˺ our children?” But when they were ordered to fight, they fled, except for a few of them. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers.",
        "Their prophet told them, “Allah has appointed Saul to be your king.” They protested, “How can he be our king when some of us are more deserving of kingship than he, and he has not been blessed with vast riches?” He replied, “Allah has chosen him over you and blessed him with knowledge and stature. Allah grants kingship to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.”",
        "Their prophet further told them, “The sign of Saul’s kingship is that the Ark will come to you—containing reassurance from your Lord and relics of the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, which will be carried by the angels. Surely in this is a sign for you, if you ˹truly˺ believe.”",
        "When Saul marched forth with his army, he cautioned: “Allah will test you with a river. So whoever drinks ˹his fill˺ from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it—except a sip from the hollow of his hands—is definitely with me.” They all drank ˹their fill˺ except for a few! When he and the ˹remaining˺ faithful with him crossed the river, they said, “Now we are no match for Goliath and his warriors.” But those ˹believers˺ who were certain they would meet Allah reasoned, “How many times has a small force vanquished a mighty army by the Will of Allah! And Allah is ˹always˺ with the steadfast.”",
        "When they advanced to face Goliath and his warriors, they prayed, “Our Lord! Shower us with perseverance, make our steps firm, and give us victory over the disbelieving people.”",
        "So they defeated them by Allah’s Will, and David killed Goliath. And Allah blessed David with kingship and wisdom and taught him what He willed. Had Allah not repelled a group of people by ˹the might of˺ another, corruption would have dominated the earth, but Allah is Gracious to all.",
        "These are Allah’s revelations which We recite to you ˹O Prophet˺ in truth. And you are truly one of the messengers.",
        "We have chosen some of those messengers above others. Allah spoke directly to some, and raised some high in rank. To Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit. If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought ˹among themselves˺ after receiving the clear proofs. But they differed—some believed while others disbelieved. Yet if Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another. But Allah does what He wills.",
        "O believers! Donate from what We have provided for you before the arrival of a Day when there will be no bargaining, friendship, or intercession. Those who disbelieve are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers.",

To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who could possibly intercede with Him without His permission? He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them, but no one can grasp any of His knowledge—except what He wills ˹to reveal˺. His Seat encompasses the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of both does not tire Him. For He is the Most High, the Greatest.",
        "Let there be no compulsion in religion, for the truth stands out clearly from falsehood. So whoever renounces false gods and believes in Allah has certainly grasped the firmest, unfailing hand-hold. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "Allah is the Guardian of the believers—He brings them out of darkness and into light. As for the disbelievers, their guardians are false gods who lead them out of light and into darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.",
        "Are you ˹O Prophet˺ not aware of the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord because Allah had granted him kingship? ˹Remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord is the One Who has power to give life and cause death.” He argued, “I too have the power to give life and cause death.” Abraham challenged ˹him˺, “Allah causes the sun to rise from the east. So make it rise from the west.” And so the disbeliever was dumbstruck. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
        "Or ˹are you not aware of˺ the one who passed by a city which was in ruins. He wondered, “How could Allah bring this back to life after its destruction?” So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years then brought him back to life. Allah asked, “How long have you remained ˹in this state˺?” He replied, “Perhaps a day or part of a day.” Allah said, “No! You have remained here for a hundred years! Just look at your food and drink—they have not spoiled. ˹But now˺ look at ˹the remains of˺ your donkey! And ˹so˺ We have made you into a sign for humanity. And look at the bones ˹of the donkey˺, how We bring them together then clothe them with flesh!” When this was made clear to him, he declared, “˹Now˺ I know that Allah is Most Capable of everything.”",
        "And ˹remember˺ when Abraham said, “My Lord! Show me how you give life to the dead.” Allah responded, “Do you not believe?” Abraham replied, “Yes I do, but just so my heart can be reassured.” Allah said, “Then bring four birds, train them to come to you, ˹then cut them into pieces,˺ and scatter them on different hilltops. Then call them back, they will fly to you in haste. And ˹so you will˺ know that Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.”",
        "The example of those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah is that of a grain that sprouts into seven ears, each bearing one hundred grains. And Allah multiplies ˹the reward even more˺ to whoever He wills. For Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.",
        "Those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah and do not follow their charity with reminders of their generosity or hurtful words—they will get their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
        "Kind words and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Self-Sufficient, Most Forbearing.",
        "O believers! Do not waste your charity with reminders ˹of your generosity˺ or hurtful words, like those who donate their wealth just to show off and do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. Their example is that of a hard barren rock covered with a thin layer of soil hit by a strong rain—leaving it just a bare stone. Such people are unable to preserve the reward of their charity. Allah does not guide ˹such˺ disbelieving people.",
        "And the example of those who donate their wealth, seeking Allah’s pleasure and believing the reward is certain, is that of a garden on a fertile hill: when heavy rain falls, it yields up twice its normal produce. If no heavy rain falls, a drizzle is sufficient. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do.",
        "Would any of you wish to have a garden with palm trees, grapevines, and all kinds of fruits with rivers flowing underneath and as they grow very old with dependent children, a fiery whirlwind hits the garden, burning it all up? This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so perhaps you will reflect.",
        "O believers! Donate from the best of what you have earned and of what We have produced for you from the earth. Do not pick out worthless things for donation, which you yourselves would only accept with closed eyes. And know that Allah is Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy.",
        "The Devil threatens you with ˹the prospect of˺ poverty and bids you to the shameful deed ˹of stinginess˺, while Allah promises you forgiveness and ˹great˺ bounties from Him. And Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing.",
        "Allah grants wisdom to whoever He wills. And whoever is granted wisdom is certainly blessed with a great privilege. But none will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason.",
        "Whatever charities you give or vows you make are surely known to Allah. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers.",
        "To give charity publicly is good, but to give to the poor privately is better for you, and will absolve you of your sins. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",
        "You are not responsible for people’s guidance ˹O Prophet˺—it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills. Whatever you ˹believers˺ spend in charity, it is for your own good—as long as you do so seeking the pleasure of Allah. Whatever you donate will be paid back to you in full, and you will not be wronged.",
        "˹Charity is˺ for the needy who are too engaged in the cause of Allah to move about in the land ˹for work˺. Those unfamiliar with their situation will think they are not in need ˹of charity˺ because they do not beg. You can recognize them by their appearance. They do not beg people persistently. Whatever you give in charity is certainly well known to Allah.",
        "Those who spend their wealth in charity day and night, secretly and openly—their reward is with their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
        "Those who consume interest will stand ˹on Judgment Day˺ like those driven to madness by Satan’s touch. That is because they say, “Trade is no different than interest.” But Allah has permitted trading and forbidden interest. Whoever refrains—after having received warning from their Lord—may keep their previous gains, and their case is left to Allah. As for those who persist, it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.",
        "Allah has made interest fruitless and charity fruitful. And Allah does not like any ungrateful evildoer.",
        "Indeed, those who believe, do good, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax will receive their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.",
        "O believers! Fear Allah, and give up outstanding interest if you are ˹true˺ believers.",
        "If you do not, then beware of a war with Allah and His Messenger! But if you repent, you may retain your principal—neither inflicting nor suffering harm.",
        "If it is difficult for someone to repay a debt, postpone it until a time of ease. And if you waive it as an act of charity, it will be better for you, if only you knew.",
        "Be mindful of the Day when you will ˹all˺ be returned to Allah, then every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be wronged.",
        "O believers! When you contract a loan for a fixed period of time, commit it to writing. Let the scribe maintain justice between the parties. The scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write. They will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not defrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness—so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. You must not be against writing ˹contracts˺ for a fixed period—whether the sum is small or great. This is more just ˹for you˺ in the sight of Allah, and more convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you conduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need for you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no harm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely exceeded ˹your limits˺. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah ˹is the One Who˺ teaches you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things.",
        "If you are on a journey and a scribe cannot be found, then a security can be taken. If you trust one another, then ˹there is no need for a security, but˺ the debtor should honour this trust ˹by repaying the debt˺—and let them fear Allah, their Lord. And do not conceal the testimony, for whoever conceals it, their hearts are indeed sinful. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows what you do.",
        "To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Whether you reveal what is in your hearts or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He forgives whoever He wills, and punishes whoever He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
        "The Messenger ˹firmly˺ believes in what has been revealed to him from his Lord, and so do the believers. They ˹all˺ believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, and His messengers. ˹They proclaim,˺ “We make no distinction between any of His messengers.” And they say, “We hear and obey. ˹We seek˺ Your forgiveness, our Lord! And to You ˹alone˺ is the final return.”",
        "Allah does not require of any soul more than what it can afford. All good will be for its own benefit, and all evil will be to its own loss. ˹The believers pray,˺ “Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us like the one you placed on those before us. Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our ˹only˺ Guardian. So grant us victory over the disbelieving people.”"

        "আর আমি বললাম, ‘হে আদম, তুমি ও তোমার স্ত্রী জান্নাতে বসবাস কর এবং তা থেকে আহার কর স্বাচ্ছন্দ্যে, তোমাদের ইচ্ছানুযায়ী এবং এই গাছটির নিকটবর্তী হয়ো না, তাহলে তোমরা যালিমদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হয়ে যাবে।",

        "আর আমি একে বানিয়েছি দৃষ্টান্ত, সে সময়ের এবং তৎপরবর্তী জনপদসমূহের জন্য এবং মুত্তাকীদের জন্য উপদেশ।",
        "আর স্মরণ কর, যখন মূসা তার কওমকে বলল, ‘নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ তোমাদেরকে নির্দেশ দিচ্ছেন যে, তোমরা একটি গাভী যবেহ করবে’। তারা বলল, ‘তুমি কি আমাদের সাথে উপহাস করছ’? সে বলল, ‘আমি মূর্খদের অন্তর্ভুক্ত হওয়া থেকে আল্লাহর আশ্রয় চাচ্ছি’।",
        "তারা বলল, ‘তুমি আমাদের জন্য তোমার রবের নিকট দো‘আ কর, তিনি যেন আমাদের জন্য স্পষ্ট করে দেন গাভীটি কেমন হবে’। সে বলল, ‘নিশ্চয় তিনি বলছেন, নিশ্চয় তা হবে গরু, বুড়ো নয় এবং বাচ্চাও নয়। এর মাঝামাঝি ধরনের। সুতরাং তোমরা কর যা তোমাদেরকে নির্দেশ দেয়া হচ্ছে’।",
        "তারা বলল, ‘তুমি আমাদের জন্য তোমার রবের নিকট দো‘আ কর, তিনি যেন আমাদের জন্য স্পষ্ট করে দেন, কেমন তার রঙ’? সে বলল, ‘নিশ্চয় তিনি বলছেন, নিশ্চয় তা হবে হলুদ রঙের গাভী, তার রঙ উজ্জ্বল, দর্শকদেরকে যা আনন্দ দেবে’।",
        "তারা বলল, ‘তুমি আমাদের জন্য তোমার রবের নিকট দো‘আ কর, তিনি যেন আমাদের জন্য স্পষ্ট করে দেন, তা কেমন? নিশ্চয় গরুটি আমাদের জন্য সন্দেহপূর্ণ হয়ে গিয়েছে। আর নিশ্চয় আমরা আল্লাহ চাহে তো পথপ্রাপ্ত হব’।",

        "আর স্মরণ কর, যখন তোমরা একজনকে হত্যা করলে অতঃপর সে ব্যাপারে একে অপরকে দোষারোপ করলে। আর আল্লাহ প্রকাশ করে দিলেন তোমরা যা গোপন করছিলে।",

        "আর যখন তারা মুমিনদের সাথে সাক্ষাৎ করে তখন বলে, ‘আমরা ঈমান এনেছি’। আর যখন একে অপরের সাথে একান্তে মিলিত হয় তখন বলে, ‘তোমরা কি তাদের সাথে সে কথা আলোচনা কর, যা আল্লাহ তোমাদের উপর উম্মুক্ত করেছেন, যাতে তারা এর মাধ্যমে তোমাদের রবের নিকট তোমাদের বিরুদ্ধে দলীল পেশ করবে? তবে কি তোমরা বুঝ না’?",

        "হে মুমিনগণ, তোমরা ‘রা‘ইনা’* বলো না; বরং বল, ‘উনজুরনা’ আর শোন, কাফিরদের জন্য রয়েছে যন্ত্রণাদায়ক আযাব। \n*- راعنا রাসূলুল্লাহ সাল্লাল্লাহু আলাইহি ওয়াসাল্লাম এর সাথে কথোপকথন বা তাঁর কাছ থেকে শিক্ষা গ্রহণের সময় মুমিনগণের বুঝতে সমস্যা হলে তারা বলতেন ‘রা‘ইনা’ অর্থাৎ আমাদের প্রতি লক্ষ্য করুন এবং ধীরে বলুন। শব্দটির আর একটি অর্থ ‘বোকা’। ইয়াহূদিরা তা শোনে সে অর্থে ব্যবহার শুরু করল এবং নিজেরা হাসি-ঠাট্টা করতে লাগল। তখন আল্লাহ তাআলা উক্ত দ্ব্যর্থবোধক শব্দটির পরিবর্তে পরিষ্কার অর্থবোধক শব্দ ‘উনজুরনা’ অর্থাৎ আমাদের প্রতি নজর দিন- শব্দটি ব্যবহার করার নির্দেশ দিলেন।",

        "অথবা সে ব্যক্তির মত, যে কোন জনপদ অতিক্রম করছিল, যা তার ছাদের উপর বিধ্বস্ত ছিল। সে বলল, ‘আল্লাহ একে কিভাবে জীবিত করবেন মরে যাওয়ার পর’? অতঃপর আল্লাহ তাকে এক’শ বছর মৃত রাখলেন। এরপর তাকে পুনর্জীবিত করলেন। বললেন, ‘তুমি কতকাল অবস্থান করেছ’? সে বলল, ‘আমি একদিন অথবা দিনের কিছু সময় অবস্থান করেছি’। তিনি বললেন, ‘বরং তুমি এক’শ বছর অবস্থান করেছ। সুতরাং তুমি তোমার খাবার ও পানীয়ের দিকে তাকাও, সেটি পরিবর্তিত হয়নি এবং তুমি তাকাও তোমরা গাধার দিকে, আর যাতে আমি তোমাকে মানুষের জন্য দৃষ্টান্ত বানাতে পারি এবং তুমি তাকাও হাড়গুলোর দিকে, কিভাবে আমি তা সংযুক্ত করি, অতঃপর তাকে আবৃত করি গোশ্ত দ্বারা’। পরে যখন তার নিকট স্পষ্ট হল, তখন সে বলল, ‘আমি জানি, নিশ্চয় আল্লাহ সব কিছুর উপর ক্ষমতাবান’।",

        "اور جب ان سے کہا جاتا ہے کہ جس طرح اور لوگ ایمان لے آئے، تم بھی ایمان لے آؤ تو کہتے ہیں، بھلا جس طرح بےوقوف ایمان لے آئے ہیں اسی طرح ہم بھی ایمان لے آئیں؟ سن لو کہ یہی بےوقوف ہیں لیکن نہیں جانتے",
        "اور یہ لوگ جب مومنوں سے ملتے ہیں تو کہتے ہیں کہ ہم ایمان لے آئے ہیں، اور جب اپنے شیطانوں میں جاتے ہیں تو (ان سے) کہتے ہیں کہ ہم تمھارے ساتھ ہیں اور (پیروانِ محمدﷺ سے) تو ہم ہنسی کیا کرتے ہیں",
        "ان (منافقوں) سے خدا ہنسی کرتا ہے اور انہیں مہلت دیئے جاتا ہے کہ شرارت وسرکشی میں پڑے بہک رہے ہیں",
        "یہ وہ لوگ ہیں جنہوں نے ہدایت چھوڑ کر گمراہی خریدی، تو نہ تو ان کی تجارت ہی نے کچھ نفع دیا اور نہ وہ ہدایت یاب ہی ہوئے",
        "ان کی مثال اس شخص کی سی ہے کہ جس نے (شبِ تاریک میں) آگ جلائی۔ جب آگ نے اس کے اردگرد کی چیزیں روشن کیں تو خدا نے ان کی روشنی زائل کر دی اور ان کو اندھیروں میں چھوڑ دیا کہ کچھ نہیں دیکھتے",
        "(یہ) بہرے ہیں، گونگے ہیں، اندھے ہیں کہ (کسی طرح سیدھے رستے کی طرف) لوٹ ہی نہیں سکتے",
        "یا ان کی مثال مینہ کی سی ہے کہ آسمان سے (برس رہا ہو اور) اس میں اندھیرے پر اندھیرا (چھا رہا) ہو اور (بادل) گرج (رہا) ہو اور بجلی (کوند رہی) ہو تو یہ کڑک سے (ڈر کر) موت کے خوف سے کانوں میں انگلیاں دے لیں اور الله کافروں کو (ہر طرف سے) گھیرے ہوئے ہے",
        "قریب ہے کہ بجلی (کی چمک) ان کی آنکھوں (کی بصارت) کو اچک لے جائے۔ جب بجلی (چمکتی اور) ان پر روشنی ڈالی ہے تو اس میں چل پڑتے ہیں اور جب اندھیرا ہو جاتا ہے تو کھڑے کے کھڑے رہ جاتے ہیں اور اگر الله چاہتا تو ان کے کانوں (کی شنوائی) اور آنکھوں (کی بینائی دونوں) کو زائل کر دیتا ہے۔ بے شک الله ہر چیز پر قادر ہے",
        "لوگو! اپنے پروردگار کی عبات کرو جس نے تم کو اور تم سے پہلے لوگوں کو پیدا کیا تاکہ تم (اس کے عذاب سے) بچو",
        "جس نے تمھارے لیے زمین کو بچھونا اور آسمان کو چھت بنایا اور آسمان سے مینہ برسا کر تمہارے کھانے کے لیے انواع و اقسام کے میوے پیدا کئے۔ پس کسی کو خدا کا ہمسر نہ بناؤ۔ اور تم جانتے تو ہو",
        "اور اگر تم کو اس (کتاب) میں، جو ہم نے اپنے بندے (محمدﷺ عربی) پر نازل فرمائی ہے کچھ شک ہو تو اسی طرح کی ایک سورت تم بھی بنا لاؤ اور خدا کے سوا جو تمہارے مددگار ہوں ان کو بھی بلالو اگر تم سچے ہو",
        "لیکن اگر (ایسا) نہ کر سکو اور ہرگز نہیں کر سکو گے تو اس آگ سے ڈرو جس کا ایندھن آدمی اور پتھر ہوں گے (اور جو) کافروں کے لیے تیار کی گئی ہے",
        "اور جو لوگ ایمان لائے اور نیک عمل کرتے رہے، ان کو خوشخبری سنا دو کہ ان کے لیے (نعمت کے) باغ ہیں، جن کے نیچے نہریں بہہ رہی ہیں۔ جب انہیں ان میں سے کسی قسم کا میوہ کھانے کو دیا جائے گا تو کہیں گے، یہ تو وہی ہے جو ہم کو پہلے دیا گیا تھا۔ اور ان کو ایک دوسرے کے ہم شکل میوے دیئے جائیں گے اور وہاں ان کے لیے پاک بیویاں ہوں گی اور وہ بہشتوں میں ہمیشہ رہیں گے",
        "الله اس بات سے عار نہیں کرتا کہ مچھر یا اس سے بڑھ کر کسی چیز (مثلاً مکھی مکڑی وغیرہ) کی مثال بیان فرمائے۔ جو مومن ہیں، وہ یقین کرتے ہیں وہ ان کے پروردگار کی طرف سے سچ ہے اور جو کافر ہیں وہ کہتے ہیں کہ اس مثال سے خدا کی مراد ہی کیا ہے۔ اس سے (خدا) بہتوں کو گمراہ کرتا ہے اور بہتوں کو ہدایت بخشتا ہے اور گمراہ بھی کرتا تو نافرمانوں ہی کو",
        "جو خدا کے اقرار کو مضبوط کرنے کے بعد توڑ دیتے ہیں اور جس چیز (یعنی رشتہٴ قرابت) کے جوڑے رکھنے کا الله نے حکم دیا ہے اس کو قطع کئے ڈالتے ہیں اور زمین میں خرابی کرتے ہیں یہی لوگ نقصان اٹھانے والے ہیں",
        "(کافرو!) تم خدا سے کیوں کر منکر ہو سکتے ہو جس حال میں کہ تم بےجان تھے تو اس نے تم کو جان بخشی پھر وہی تم کو مارتا ہے پھر وہی تم کو زندہ کرے گا پھر تم اسی کی طرف لوٹ کر جاؤ گے",
        "وہی تو ہے جس نے سب چیزیں جو زمین میں ہیں تمہارے لیے پیدا کیں پھر آسمان کی طرف متوجہ ہوا تو ان کو ٹھیک سات آسمان بنا دیا اور وہ ہر چیز سے خبردار ہے",
        "اور (وہ وقت یاد کرنے کے قابل ہے) جب تمہارے پروردگار نے فرشتوں سے فرمایا کہ میں زمین میں (اپنا) نائب بنانے والا ہوں۔ انہوں نے کہا۔ کیا تُو اس میں ایسے شخص کو نائب بنانا چاہتا ہے جو خرابیاں کرے اور کشت وخون کرتا پھرے اور ہم تیری تعریف کے ساتھ تسبیح وتقدیس کرتے رہتے ہیں۔ (خدا نے) فرمایا میں وہ باتیں جانتا ہوں جو تم نہیں جانتے",
        "اور اس نے آدم کو سب (چیزوں کے) نام سکھائے پھر ان کو فرشتوں کے سامنے کیا اور فرمایا کہ اگر تم سچے ہو تو مجھے ان کے نام بتاؤ",
        "انہوں نے کہا، تو پاک ہے۔ جتنا علم تو نے ہمیں بخشا ہے، اس کے سوا ہمیں کچھ معلوم نہیں۔ بے شک تو دانا (اور) حکمت والا ہے",
        "(تب) خدا نے (آدم کو) حکم دیا کہ آدم! تم ان کو ان (چیزوں) کے نام بتاؤ۔ جب انہوں نے ان کو ان کے نام بتائے تو (فرشتوں سے) فرمایا کیوں میں نے تم سے نہیں کہا تھا کہ میں آسمانوں اور زمین کی (سب) پوشیدہ باتیں جاتنا ہوں اور جو تم ظاہر کرتے ہو اور جو پوشیدہ کرتے ہو (سب) مجھ کو معلوم ہے",
        "اور جب ہم نے فرشتوں کو حکم دیا کہ آدم کے آگے سجدہ کرو تو وہ سجدے میں گر پڑے مگر شیطان نے انکار کیا اور غرور میں آکر کافر بن گیا",
        "اور ہم نے کہا کہ اے آدم تم اور تمہاری بیوی بہشت میں رہو اور جہاں سے چاہو بے روک ٹوک کھاؤ (پیو) لیکن اس درخت کے پاس نہ جانا نہیں تو ظالموں میں (داخل) ہو جاؤ گے",
        "پھر شیطان نے دونوں کو وہاں سے پھسلا دیا اور جس (عیش ونشاط) میں تھے، اس سے ان کو نکلوا دیا۔ تب ہم نے حکم دیا کہ (بہشت بریں سے) چلے جاؤ۔ تم ایک دوسرے کے دشمن ہو، اور تمہارے لیے زمین میں ایک وقت تک ٹھکانا اور معاش (مقرر کر دیا گیا) ہے",
        "پھر آدم نے اپنے پروردگار سے کچھ کلمات سیکھے (اور معافی مانگی) تو اس نے ان کا قصور معاف کر دیا بے شک وہ معاف کرنے والا (اور) صاحبِ رحم ہے",
        "ہم نے فرمایا کہ تم سب یہاں سے اتر جاؤ جب تمہارے پاس میری طرف سے ہدایت پہنچے تو (اس کی پیروی کرنا کہ) جنہوں نے میری ہدایت کی پیروی کی ان کو نہ کچھ خوف ہوگا اور نہ وہ غمناک ہوں گے",
        "اور جنہوں نے (اس کو) قبول نہ کیا اور ہماری آیتوں کو جھٹلایا، وہ دوزخ میں جانے والے ہیں (اور) وہ ہمیشہ اس میں رہیں گے",
        "اے یعقوب کی اولاد! میرے وہ احسان یاد کرو جو میں نے تم پر کئے تھے اور اس اقرار کو پورا کرو جو تم نے مجھ سے کیا تھا۔ میں اس اقرار کو پورا کروں گا جو میں نے تم سے کیا تھا اور مجھی سے ڈرتے رہو",
        "اور جو کتاب میں نے (اپنے رسول محمدﷺ پر) نازل کی ہے جو تمہاری کتاب تورات کو سچا کہتی ہے، اس پر ایمان لاؤ اور اس سے منکرِ اول نہ بنو، اور میری آیتوں میں (تحریف کر کے) ان کے بدلے تھوڑی سی قیمت (یعنی دنیاوی منعفت) نہ حاصل کرو، اور مجھی سے خوف رکھو",
        "اور حق کو باطل کے ساتھ نہ ملاؤ، اور سچی بات کو جان بوجھ کر نہ چھپاؤ",
        "اور نماز پڑھا کرو اور زکوٰة دیا کرو اور (خدا کے آگے) جھکنے والوں کے ساتھ جھکا کرو",
        "(یہ) کیا (عقل کی بات ہے کہ) تم لوگوں کو نیکی کرنے کو کہتے ہو اور اپنے تئیں فراموش کئے دیتے ہو، حالانکہ تم کتاب (خدا) بھی پڑھتے ہو۔ کیا تم سمجھتے نہیں؟",
        "اور (رنج وتکلیف میں) صبر اور نماز سے مدد لیا کرو اور بے شک نماز گراں ہے، مگر ان لوگوں پر (گراں نہیں) جو عجز کرنے والے ہیں",
        "اور جو یقین کئے ہوئے ہیں کہ وہ اپنے پروردگار سے ملنے والے ہیں اور اس کی طرف لوٹ کر جانے والے ہیں",
        "اے یعقوب کی اولاد! میرے وہ احسان یاد کرو، جو میں نے تم پر کئے تھے اور یہ کہ میں نے تم کو جہان کے لوگوں پر فضیلت بخشی تھی",
        "اور اس دن سے ڈرو جب کوئی کسی کے کچھ کام نہ آئے اور نہ کسی کی سفارش منظور کی جائے اور نہ کسی سے کسی طرح کا بدلہ قبول کیا جائے اور نہ لوگ (کسی اور طرح) مدد حاصل کر سکیں",
        "اور (ہمارے ان احسانات کو یاد کرو) جب ہم نے تم کو قومِ فرعون سے نجات بخشی وہ (لوگ) تم کو بڑا دکھ دیتے تھے تمہارے بیٹوں کو تو قتل کر ڈالتے تھے اور بیٹیوں کو زندہ رہنے دیتے تھے اور اس میں تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے بڑی (سخت) آزمائش تھی",
        "اور جب ہم نے تمہارے لیے دریا کو پھاڑ دیا تم کو نجات دی اور فرعون کی قوم کو غرق کر دیا اور تم دیکھ ہی تو رہے تھے",
        "اور جب ہم نے موسیٰ سے چالیس رات کا وعدہ کیا تو تم نے ان کے پیچھے بچھڑے کو (معبود) مقرر کر لیا اور تم ظلم کر رہے تھے",
        "پھر اس کے بعد ہم نے تم کو معاف کر دیا، تاکہ تم شکر کرو",
        "اور جب ہم نے موسیٰ کو کتاب اور معجزے عنایت کئے، تاکہ تم ہدایت حاصل کرو",
        "اور جب موسیٰ نے اپنی قوم کے لوگوں سے کہا کہ بھائیو، تم نے بچھڑے کو (معبود) ٹھہرانے میں (بڑا) ظلم کیا ہے، تو اپنے پیدا کرنے والے کے آگے توبہ کرو اور اپنے تئیں ہلاک کر ڈالو۔ تمہارے خالق کے نزدیک تمہارے حق میں یہی بہتر ہے۔ پھر اس نے تمہارا قصور معاف کر دیا۔ وہ بے شک معاف کرنے والا (اور) صاحبِ رحم ہے",
        "اور جب تم نے (موسیٰ) سے کہا کہ موسیٰ، جب تک ہم خدا کو سامنے نہ دیکھ لیں گے، تم پر ایمان نہیں لائیں گے، تو تم کو بجلی نے آ گھیرا اور تم دیکھ رہے تھے",
        "پھر موت آ جانے کے بعد ہم نے تم کو ازسرِ نو زندہ کر دیا، تاکہ احسان مانو",
        "اور بادل کا تم پر سایہ کئے رکھا اور (تمہارے لیے) من و سلویٰ اتارتے رہے کہ جو پاکیزہ چیزیں ہم نے تم کو عطا فرمائی ہیں، ان کو کھاؤ (پیو) مگر تمہارے بزرگوں نے ان نعمتوں کی کچھ قدر نہ جانی (اور) وہ ہمارا کچھ نہیں بگاڑتے تھے بلکہ اپنا ہی نقصان کرتے تھے",
        "اور جب ہم نے (ان سے) کہا کہ اس گاؤں میں داخل ہو جاؤ اور اس میں جہاں سے چاہو، خوب کھاؤ (پیو) اور (دیکھنا) دروازے میں داخل ہونا تو سجدہ کرنا اور حطة کہنا، ہم تمہارے گناہ معاف کر دیں گے اور نیکی کرنے والوں کو اور زیادہ دیں گے",
        "تو جو ظالم تھے، انہوں نے اس لفظ کو، جس کا ان کو حکم دیا تھا، بدل کر اس کی جگہ اور لفظ کہنا شروع کیا، پس ہم نے (ان) ظالموں پر آسمان سے عذاب نازل کیا، کیونکہ نافرمانیاں کئے جاتے تھے",
        "اور جب موسیٰ نے اپنی قوم کے لیے (خدا سے) پانی مانگا تو ہم نے کہا کہ اپنی لاٹھی پتھر پر مارو۔ (انہوں نے لاٹھی ماری) تو پھر اس میں سے بارہ چشمے پھوٹ نکلے، اور تمام لوگوں نے اپنا اپنا گھاٹ معلوم کر (کے پانی پی) لیا۔ (ہم نے حکم دیا کہ) خدا کی (عطا فرمائی ہوئی) روزی کھاؤ اور پیو، مگر زمین میں فساد نہ کرتے پھرنا",
        "اور جب تم نے کہا کہ موسیٰ! ہم سے ایک (ہی) کھانے پر صبر نہیں ہو سکتا تو اپنے پروردگار سے دعا کیجئے کہ ترکاری اور ککڑی اور گیہوں اور مسور اور پیاز (وغیرہ) جو نباتات زمین سے اُگتی ہیں، ہمارے لیے پیدا کر دے۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ بھلا عمدہ چیزیں چھوڑ کر ان کے عوض ناقص چیزیں کیوں چاہتے ہوں۔ (اگر یہی چیزیں مطلوب ہیں) تو کسی شہر میں جا اترو، وہاں جو مانگتے ہو، مل جائے گا۔ اور (آخرکار) ذلت (ورسوائی) اور محتاجی (وبے نوائی) ان سے چمٹا دی گئی اور وہ الله کے غضب میں گرفتار ہو گئے۔ یہ اس لیے کہ وہ الله کی آیتوں سے انکار کرتے تھے اور (اس کے) نبیوں کو ناحق قتل کر دیتے تھے۔ (یعنی) یہ اس لیے کہ نافرمانی کئے جاتے اور حد سے بڑھے جاتے تھے",
        "جو لوگ مسلمان ہیں یا یہودی یا عیسائی یا ستارہ پرست، (یعنی کوئی شخص کسی قوم و مذہب کا ہو) جو خدا اور روز قیامت پر ایمان لائے گا، اور نیک عمل کرے گا، تو ایسے لوگوں کو ان (کے اعمال) کا صلہ خدا کے ہاں ملے گا اور (قیامت کے دن) ان کو نہ کسی طرح کا خوف ہوگا اور نہ وہ غم ناک ہوں گے",
        "اور جب ہم نے تم سے عہد (کر) لیا اور کوہِ طُور کو تم پر اٹھا کھڑا کیا (اور حکم دیا) کہ جو کتاب ہم نے تم کو دی ہے، اس کو زور سے پکڑے رہو، اور جو اس میں (لکھا) ہے، اسے یاد رکھو، تاکہ (عذاب سے) محفوظ رہو",
        "تو تم اس کے بعد (عہد سے) پھر گئے اور اگر تم پر خدا کا فضل اور اس کی مہربانی نہ ہوتی تو تم خسارے میں پڑے گئے ہوتے",
        "اور تم ان لوگوں کو خوب جانتے ہوں، جو تم میں سے ہفتے کے دن (مچھلی کا شکار کرنے) میں حد سے تجاوز کر گئے تھے، تو ہم نے ان سے کہا کہ ذلیل وخوار بندر ہو جاؤ",
        "اور اس قصے کو اس وقت کے لوگوں کے لیے اور جو ان کے بعد آنے والے تھے عبرت اور پرہیز گاروں کے لیے نصیحت بنا دیا",
        "اور جب موسیٰ نے اپنی قوم کے لوگوں سے کہا کہ خدا تم کو حکم دیتا ہے کہ ایک بیل ذبح کرو۔ وہ بولے، کیا تم ہم سے ہنسی کرتے ہو۔ (موسیٰ نے) کہا کہ میں الله کی پناہ مانگتا ہوں کہ نادان بنوں",
        "انہوں نے کہا کہ اپنے پروردگار سے التجا کیجئے کہ وہ ہمیں یہ بتائے کہ وہ بیل کس طرح کا ہو۔ (موسیٰ نے) کہا کہ پروردگار فرماتا ہے کہ وہ بیل نہ تو بوڑھا ہو اور نہ بچھڑا، بلکہ ان کے درمیان (یعنی جوان) ہو۔ جیسا تم کو حکم دیا گیا ہے، ویسا کرو",
        "انہوں نے کہا کہ پروردگار سے درخواست کیجئے کہ ہم کو یہ بھی بتائے کہ اس کا رنگ کیسا ہو۔ موسیٰ نے کہا ، پروردگار فرماتا ہے کہ اس کا رنگ گہرا زرد ہو کہ دیکھنے والوں (کے دل) کو خوش کر دیتا ہو",
        "انہوں نے کہا کہ (اب کے) پروردگار سے پھر درخواست کیجئے کہ ہم کو بتا دے کہ وہ اور کس کس طرح کا ہو، کیونکہ بہت سے بیل ہمیں ایک دوسرے کے مشابہ معلوم ہوتے ہیں، (پھر) خدا نے چاہا تو ہمیں ٹھیک بات معلوم ہو جائے گی",
        "موسیٰ نے کہا کہ خدا فرماتا ہے کہ وہ بیل کام میں لگا ہوا نہ ہو، نہ تو زمین جوتتا ہو اور نہ کھیتی کو پانی دیتا ہو۔ اس میں کسی طرح کا داغ نہ ہو۔ کہنے لگے، اب تم نے سب باتیں درست بتا دیں۔ غرض (بڑی مشکل سے) انہوں نے اس بیل کو ذبح کیا، اور وہ ایسا کرنے والے تھے نہیں",
        "اور جب تم نے ایک شخص کو قتل کیا، تو اس میں باہم جھگڑنے لگے۔ لیکن جو بات تم چھپا رہے تھے، خدا اس کو ظاہر کرنے والا تھا",
        "تو ہم نے کہا کہ اس بیل کا کوئی سا ٹکڑا مقتول کو مارو۔ اس طرح خدا مردوں کو زندہ کرتا ہے اور تم کو اپنی (قدرت کی) نشانیاں دکھاتا ہے تاکہ تم سمجھو",
        "پھر اس کے بعد تمہارے دل سخت ہو گئے۔ گویا وہ پتھر ہیں یا ان سے بھی زیادہ سخت۔ اور پتھر تو بعضے ایسے ہوتے ہیں کہ ان میں سے چشمے پھوٹ نکلتے ہیں، اور بعضے ایسے ہوتے ہیں کہ پھٹ جاتے ہیں،اور ان میں سے پانی نکلنے لگتا ہے، اور بعضے ایسے ہوتے ہیں کہ خدا کے خوف سے گر پڑتے ہیں، اور خدا تمہارے عملوں سے بے خبر نہیں",
        "(مومنو) کیا تم امید رکھتے ہو کہ یہ لوگ تمہارے (دین کے) قائل ہو جائیں گے، (حالانکہ) ان میں سے کچھ لوگ کلامِ خدا (یعنی تورات) کو سنتے، پھر اس کے سمجھ لینے کے بعد اس کو جان بوجھ کر بدل دیتے رہے ہیں",
        "اور یہ لوگ جب مومنوں سے ملتے ہیں تو کہتے ہیں، ہم ایمان لے آئے ہیں۔ اور جب آپس میں ایک دوسرے سے ملتے ہیں تو کہتے ہیں، جو بات خدا نے تم پر ظاہر فرمائی ہے، وہ تم ان کو اس لیے بتائے دیتے ہو کہ (قیامت کے دن) اسی کے حوالے سے تمہارے پروردگار کے سامنے تم کو الزام دیں۔ کیا تم سمجھتے نہیں؟",
        "کیا یہ لوگ یہ نہیں جانتے کہ جو کچھ یہ چھپاتے اور جو کچھ ظاہر کرتے ہیں، خدا کو (سب) معلوم ہے",
        "اور بعض ان میں ان پڑھ ہیں کہ اپنے باطل خیالات کے سوا (خدا کی) کتاب سے واقف ہی نہیں اور وہ صرف ظن سے کام لیتے ہیں",
        "تو ان لوگوں پر افسوس ہے جو اپنے ہاتھ سے تو کتاب لکھتے ہیں اور کہتے یہ ہیں کہ یہ خدا کے پاس سے (آئی) ہے، تاکہ اس کے عوض تھوڑی سے قیمت (یعنی دنیوی منفعت) حاصل کریں۔ ان پر افسوس ہے، اس لیے کہ (بےاصل باتیں) اپنے ہاتھ سے لکھتے ہیں اور (پھر) ان پر افسوس ہے، اس لیے کہ ایسے کام کرتے ہیں",
        "اور کہتے ہیں کہ (دوزخ کی) آگ ہمیں چند روز کے سوا چھو ہی نہیں سکے گی۔ ان سے پوچھو، کیا تم نے خدا سے اقرار لے رکھا ہے کہ خدا اپنے اقرار کے خلاف نہیں کرے گا۔ (نہیں)، بلکہ تم خدا کے بارے میں ایسی باتیں کہتے ہو جن کا تمہیں مطلق علم نہیں",
        "ہاں جو برے کام کرے، اور اس کے گناہ (ہر طرف سے) گھیر لیں تو ایسے لوگ دوزخ (میں جانے) والے ہیں (اور) وہ ہمیشہ اس میں (جلتے) رہیں گے",
        "اور جو ایمان لائیں اور نیک کام کریں، وہ جنت کے مالک ہوں گے (اور) ہمیشہ اس میں (عیش کرتے) رہیں گے",
        "اور جب ہم نے بنی اسرائیل سے عہد لیا کہ خدا کے سوا کسی کی عبادت نہ کرنا اور ماں باپ اور رشتہ داروں اور یتیموں اور محتاجوں کے ساتھ بھلائی کرتے رہنا اور لوگوں سے اچھی باتیں کہنا، اور نماز پڑھتے اور زکوٰة دیتے رہنا، تو چند شخصوں کے سوا تم سب (اس عہد سے) منہ پھیر کر پھر بیٹھے",
        "اور جب ہم نے تم سے عہد لیا کہ آپس میں کشت وخون نہ کرنا اور اپنے کو ان کے وطن سے نہ نکالنا تو تم نے اقرار کر لیا، اور تم (اس بات کے) گواہ ہو",
        "پھر تم وہی ہو کہ اپنوں کو قتل بھی کر دیتے ہو اور اپنے میں سے بعض لوگوں پر گناہ اور ظلم سے چڑھائی کرکے انہیں وطن سے نکال بھی دیتے ہو، اور اگر وہ تمہارے پاس قید ہو کر آئیں تو بدلہ دے کر ان کو چھڑا بھی لیتے ہو، حالانکہ ان کا نکال دینا ہی تم کو حرام تھا۔ (یہ) کیا (بات ہے کہ) تم کتابِ (خدا) کے بعض احکام کو تو مانتے ہو اور بعض سے انکار کئے دیتے ہو، تو جو تم میں سے ایسی حرکت کریں، ان کی سزا اس کے سوا اور کیا ہو سکتی ہے کہ دنیا کی زندگی میں تو رسوائی ہو اور قیامت کے دن سخت سے سخت عذاب میں ڈال دیئے جائیں اور جو کام تم کرتے ہو، خدا ان سے غافل نہیں",
        "یہ وہ لوگ ہیں جنہوں نے آخرت کے بدلے دنیا کی زندگی خریدی۔ سو نہ تو ان سے عذاب ہی ہلکا کیا جائے گا اور نہ ان کو (اور طرح کی) مدد ملے گی",
        "اور ہم نے موسیٰ کو کتاب عنایت کی اور ان کے پیچھے یکے بعد دیگرے پیغمبر بھیجتے رہے اور عیسیٰ بن مریم کو کھلے نشانات بخشے اور روح القدس (یعنی جبرئیل) سے ان کو مدد دی۔تو جب کوئی پیغمبر تمہارے پاس ایسی باتیں لے کر آئے، جن کو تمہارا جی نہیں چاہتا تھا، تو تم سرکش ہو جاتے رہے، اور ایک گروہ (انبیاء) کو تو جھٹلاتے رہے اور ایک گروہ کو قتل کرتے رہے",
        "اور کہتے ہیں، ہمارے دل پردے میں ہیں۔ (نہیں) بلکہ الله نے ان کے کفر کے سبب ان پر لعنت کر رکھی ہے۔ پس یہ تھوڑے ہی پر ایمان لاتے ہیں",
        "اور جب الله کے ہاں سے ان کے پاس کتاب آئی جو ان کی (آسمانی) کتاب کی بھی تصدیق کرتی ہے، اور وہ پہلے (ہمیشہ) کافروں پر فتح مانگا کرتے تھے، تو جس چیز کو وہ خوب پہچانتے تھے، جب ان کے پاس آپہنچی تو اس سے کافر ہو گئے۔ پس کافروں پر الله کی لعنت",
        "جس چیز کے بدلے انہوں نے اپنے تئیں بیچ ڈالا، وہ بہت بری ہے، یعنی اس جلن سے کہ خدا اپنے بندوں میں جس پر چاہتا ہے، اپنی مہربانی سے نازل فرماتا ہے۔ خدا کی نازل کی ہوئی کتاب سے کفر کرنے لگے تو وہ (اس کے) غضب بالائے غضب میں مبتلا ہو گئے۔ اور کافروں کے لیے ذلیل کرنے والا عذاب ہے",
        "اور جب ان سے کہا جاتا ہے کہ جو (کتاب) خدا نے (اب) نازل فرمائی ہے، اس کو مانو۔ تو کہتے ہیں کہ جو کتاب ہم پر (پہلے) نازل ہو چکی ہے، ہم تو اسی کو مانتے ہیں۔ (یعنی) یہ اس کے سوا کسی اور (کتاب) کو نہیں مانتے، حالانکہ وہ (سراسر) سچی ہے اور جو ان کی (آسمانی) کتاب ہے، اس کی بھی تصدیق کرتی ہے۔ (ان سے) کہہ دو کہ اگر تم صاحبِ ایمان ہوتے تو الله کے پیغمبروں کو پہلے ہی کیوں قتل کیا کرتے",
        "اور موسیٰ تمہارے پاس کھلے ہوئے معجزات لے کر آئے تو تم ان کے (کوہِ طور جانے کے) بعد بچھڑے کو معبود بنا بیٹھے اور تم (اپنے ہی حق میں) ظلم کرتے تھے",
        "اور جب ہم نے تم (لوگوں) سے عہد واثق لیا اور کوہ طور کو تم پر اٹھا کھڑا کیا (اور حکم دیا کہ) جو (کتاب) ہم نے تم کو دی ہے، اس کو زور سے پکڑو اور جو تمہیں حکم ہوتا ہے (اس کو) سنو تو وہ (جو تمہارے بڑے تھے) کہنے لگے کہ ہم نے سن تو لیا لیکن مانتے نہیں۔ اور ان کے کفر کے سبب بچھڑا (گویا) ان کے دلوں میں رچ گیا تھا۔ (اے پیغمبر ان سے) کہہ دو کہ اگر تم مومن ہو تو تمہارا ایمان تم کو بری بات بتاتا ہے",
        "کہہ دو کہ اگر آخرت کا گھر اور لوگوں (یعنی مسلمانوں) کے لیے نہیں اور خدا کے نزدیک تمہارے ہی لیے مخصوص ہے تو اگر سچے ہو تو موت کی آرزو تو کرو",
        "لیکن ان اعمال کی وجہ سے، جو ان کے ہاتھ آگے بھیج چکے ہیں، یہ کبھی اس کی آرزو نہیں کریں گے، اور خدا ظالموں سے (خوب) واقف ہے",
        "بلکہ ان کو تم اور لوگوں سے زندگی کے کہیں حریص دیکھو گے، یہاں تک کہ مشرکوں سے بھی۔ ان میں سے ہر ایک یہی خواہش کرتا ہے کہ کاش وہ ہزار برس جیتا رہے، مگر اتنی لمبی عمر اس کو مل بھی جائے تو اسے عذاب سے تو نہیں چھڑا سکتی۔ اور جو کام یہ کرتے ہیں، خدا ان کو دیکھ رہا ہے",
        "کہہ دو کہ جو شخص جبرئیل کا دشمن ہو (اس کو غصے میں مر جانا چاہیئے) اس نے تو (یہ کتاب) خدا کے حکم سے تمہارے دل پر نازل کی ہے جو پہلی کتابوں کی تصدیق کرتی ہے، اور ایمان والوں کے لیے ہدایت اور بشارت ہے",
        "جو شخص خدا کا اور اس کے فرشتوں کا اور اس کے پیغمبروں کا اور جبرئیل اور میکائیل کا دشمن ہو تو ایسے کافروں کا خدا دشمن ہے",
        "اور ہم نے تمہارے پاس سلجھی ہوئی آیتیں ارسال فرمائی ہیں، اور ان سے انکار وہی کرتے ہیں جو بدکار ہیں",
        "ان لوگوں نے جب (خدا سے) عہد واثق کیا تو ان میں سے ایک فریق نے اس کو (کسی چیز کی طرح) پھینک دیا۔ حقیقت یہ ہے کہ ان میں اکثر بے ایمان ہیں",
        "اور جب ان کے پاس الله کی طرف سے پیغمبر (آخرالزماں) آئے، اور وہ ان کی (آسمانی) کتاب کی بھی تصدیق کرتے ہیں تو جن لوگوں کو کتاب دی گئی تھی، ان میں سے ایک جماعت نے خدا کی کتاب کو پیٹھ پیچھے پھینک دیا، گویا وہ جانتے ہی نہیں",
        "اور ان (ہزلیات) کے پیچھے لگ گئے جو سلیمان کے عہدِ سلطنت میں شیاطین پڑھا کرتے تھے اور سلیمان نے مطلق کفر کی بات نہیں کی، بلکہ شیطان ہی کفر کرتے تھے کہ لوگوں کو جادو سکھاتے تھے۔ اور ان باتوں کے بھی (پیچھے لگ گئے) جو شہر بابل میں دو فرشتوں (یعنی) ہاروت اور ماروت پر اتری تھیں۔ اور وہ دونوں کسی کو کچھ نہیں سکھاتے تھے، جب تک یہ نہ کہہ دیتے کہ ہم تو (ذریعہٴ) آزمائش ہیں۔ تم کفر میں نہ پڑو۔ غرض لوگ ان سے (ایسا) جادو سیکھتے، جس سے میاں بیوی میں جدائی ڈال دیں۔ اور خدا کے حکم کے سوا وہ اس (جادو) سے کسی کا کچھ بھی نہیں بگاڑ سکتے تھے۔ اور کچھ ایسے (منتر) سیکھتے جو ان کو نقصان ہی پہنچاتے اور فائدہ کچھ نہ دیتے۔ اور وہ جانتے تھے کہ جو شخص ایسی چیزوں (یعنی سحر اور منتر وغیرہ) کا خریدار ہوگا، اس کا آخرت میں کچھ حصہ نہیں۔ اور جس چیز کے عوض انہوں نے اپنی جانوں کو بیچ ڈالا، وہ بری تھی۔ کاش وہ (اس بات کو) جانتے",
        "اور اگر وہ ایمان لاتے اور پرہیز گاری کرتے تو خدا کے ہاں سے بہت اچھا صلہ ملتا۔ اے کاش، وہ اس سے واقف ہوتے",
        "اے اہل ایمان! (گفتگو کے وقت پیغمبرِ خدا سے) راعنا نہ کہا کرو۔ انظرنا کہا کرو۔ اور خوب سن رکھو، اور کافروں کے لیے دکھ دینے والا عذاب ہے",
        "جو لوگ کافر ہیں، اہل کتاب یا مشرک وہ اس بات کو پسند نہیں کرتے کہ تم پر تمہارے پروردگار کی طرف سے خیر (وبرکت) نازل ہو۔ اور خدا تو جس کو چاہتا ہے، اپنی رحمت کے ساتھ خاص کر لیتا ہے اور خدا بڑے فضل کا مالک ہے",
        "ہم جس آیت کو منسوخ کر دیتے یا اسے فراموش کرا دیتے ہیں تو اس سے بہتر یا ویسی ہی اور آیت بھیج دیتے ہیں۔ کیا تم نہیں جانتے کہ خدا ہر بات پر قادر ہے",
        "تمہیں معلوم نہیں کہ آسمانوں اور زمین کی بادشاہت خدا ہی کی ہے، اور خدا کے سوا تمہارا کوئی دوست اور مدد گار نہیں",
        "کیا تم یہ چاہتے ہو کہ اپنے پیغمبر سے اسی طرح کے سوال کرو، جس طرح کے سوال پہلے موسیٰ سے کئے گئے تھے۔ اور جس شخص نے ایمان (چھوڑ کر اس) کے بدلے کفر لیا، وہ سیدھے رستے سے بھٹک گیا",
        "بہت سے اہل کتاب اپنے دل کی جلن سے یہ چاہتے ہیں کہ ایمان لا چکنے کے بعد تم کو پھر کافر بنا دیں۔ حالانکہ ان پر حق ظاہر ہو چکا ہے۔ تو تم معاف کردو اور درگزر کرو۔ یہاں تک کہ خدا اپنا (دوسرا) حکم بھیجے۔ بے شک خدا ہر بات پر قادر ہے",
        "اور نماز ادا کرتے رہو اور زکوٰة دیتے رہو۔ اور جو بھلائی اپنے لیے آگے بھیج رکھو گے، اس کو خدا کے ہاں پا لو گے۔ کچھ شک نہیں کہ خدا تمہارے سب کاموں کو دیکھ رہا ہے",
        "اور (یہودی اور عیسائی) کہتے ہیں کہ یہودیوں اور عیسائیوں کے سوا کوئی بہشت میں نہیں جانے کا۔ یہ ان لوگوں کے خیالاتِ باطل ہیں۔ (اے پیغمبر ان سے) کہہ دو کہ اگر سچے ہو تو دلیل پیش کرو",
        "ہاں جو شخص خدا کے آگے گردن جھکا دے، (یعنی ایمان لے آئے) اور وہ نیکو کار بھی ہو تو اس کا صلہ اس کے پروردگار کے پاس ہے اور ایسے لوگوں کو (قیامت کے دن) نہ کسی طرح کا خوف ہوگا اور نہ وہ غمناک ہوں گے",
        "اور یہودی کہتے ہیں کہ عیسائی رستے پر نہیں اور عیسائی کہتے ہیں کہ یہودی رستے پر نہیں۔ حالانکہ وہ کتاب (الہٰی) پڑھتے ہیں۔ اسی طرح بالکل انہی کی سی بات وہ لوگ کہتے ہیں جو (کچھ) نہیں جانتے (یعنی مشرک) تو جس بات میں یہ لوگ اختلاف کر رہے خدا قیامت کے دن اس کا ان میں فیصلہ کر دے گا",
        "اور اس سے بڑھ کر ظالم کون، جو خدا کی مسجدوں میں خدا کے نام کا ذکر کئے جانے کو منع کرے اور ان کی ویرانی میں ساعی ہو۔ان لوگوں کو کچھ حق نہیں کہ ان میں داخل ہوں، مگر ڈرتے ہوئے۔ ان کے لیے دنیا میں رسوائی ہے اور آخرت میں بڑا عذاب",
        "اور مشرق اور مغرب سب خدا ہی کا ہے۔ تو جدھر تم رخ کرو۔ ادھر خدا کی ذات ہے۔ بے شک خدا صاحبِ وسعت اور باخبر ہے",
        "اور یہ لوگ اس بات کے قائل ہیں کہ خدا اولاد رکھتا ہے۔ (نہیں) وہ پاک ہے، بلکہ جو کچھ آسمانوں اور زمین میں ہے، سب اسی کا ہے اور سب اس کے فرماں بردار ہیں",
        "(وہی) آسمانوں اور زمین کا پیدا کرنے والاہے۔ جب کوئی کام کرنا چاہتا ہے تو اس کو ارشاد فرما دیتا ہے کہ ہوجا تو وہ ہو جاتا ہے .",
        "اور جو لوگ (کچھ) نہیں جانتے (یعنی مشرک) وہ کہتے ہیں کہ خدا ہم سے کلام کیوں نہیں کرتا۔ یا ہمارے پاس کوئی نشانی کیوں نہیں آتی۔ اسی طرح جو لوگ ان سے پہلے تھے، وہ بھی انہی کی سی باتیں کیا کرتے تھے۔ ان لوگوں کے دل آپس میں ملتے جلتے ہیں۔ جو لوگ صاحبِ یقین ہیں، ان کے (سمجھانے کے) لیے نشانیاں بیان کردی ہیں",
        "(اے محمدﷺ) ہم نے تم کو سچائی کے ساتھ خوشخبری سنانے والا اور ڈرانے والا بنا کر بھیجا ہے۔ اور اہل دوزخ کے بارے میں تم سے کچھ پرسش نہیں ہوگی",
        "اور تم سے نہ تو یہودی کبھی خوش ہوں گے اور نہ عیسائی، یہاں تک کہ تم ان کے مذہب کی پیروی اختیار کرلو۔ (ان سے) کہہ دو کہ خدا کی ہدایت (یعنی دین اسلام) ہی ہدایت ہے۔ اور (اے پیغمبر) اگر تم اپنے پاس علم (یعنی وحی خدا) کے آ جانے پر بھی ان کی خواہشوں پر چلو گے تو تم کو (عذاب) خدا سے (بچانے والا) نہ کوئی دوست ہوگا اور نہ کوئی مددگار",
        "جن لوگوں کو ہم نے کتاب عنایت کی ہے، وہ اس کو (ایسا) پڑھتے ہیں جیسا اس کے پڑھنے کا حق ہے۔ یہی لوگ اس پر ایمان رکھنے والے ہیں، اور جو اس کو نہیں مانتے، وہ خسارہ پانے والے ہیں",
        "اے بنی اسرائیل ! میرے وہ احسان یاد کرو، جو میں نے تم پر کئے اور یہ کہ میں نے تم کو اہلِ عالم پر فضیلت بخشی",
        "اور اس دن سے ڈرو جب کوئی شخص کسی شخص کے کچھ کام نہ آئے، اور نہ اس سے بدلہ قبول کیا جائے اور نہ اس کو کسی کی سفارش کچھ فائدہ دے اور نہ لوگوں کو (کسی اور طرح کی) مدد مل سکے",
        "اور جب پروردگار نے چند باتوں میں ابراہیم کی آزمائش کی تو ان میں پورے اترے۔ خدا نے کہا کہ میں تم کو لوگوں کا پیشوا بناؤں گا۔ انہوں نے کہا کہ (پروردگار) میری اولاد میں سے بھی (پیشوا بنائیو)۔ خدا نے فرمایا کہ ہمارا اقرار ظالموں کے لیے نہیں ہوا کرتا",
        "اور جب ہم نے خانہٴ کعبہ کو لوگوں کے لیے جمع ہونے اور امن پانے کی جگہ مقرر کیا اور (حکم دیا کہ) جس مقام پر ابراہیم کھڑے ہوئے تھے، اس کو نماز کی جگہ بنا لو۔ اور ابراہیم اور اسمٰعیل کو کہا کہ طواف کرنے والوں اور اعتکاف کرنے والوں اور رکوع کرنے والوں اور سجدہ کرنے والوں کے لیے میرے گھر کو پاک صاف رکھا کرو",
        "اور جب ابراہیم نے دعا کی کہ اے پروردگار، اس جگہ کو امن کا شہر بنا اور اس کے رہنے والوں میں سے جو خدا پر اور روزِ آخرت پر ایمان لائیں، ان کے کھانے کو میوے عطا کر، تو خدا نے فرمایا کہ جو کافر ہوگا، میں اس کو بھی کسی قدر متمتع کروں گا، (مگر) پھر اس کو (عذاب) دوزخ کے (بھگتنے کے) لیے ناچار کردوں گا، اور وہ بری جگہ ہے",
        "اور جب ابراہیم اور اسمٰعیل بیت الله کی بنیادیں اونچی کر رہے تھے (تو دعا کئے جاتے تھے کہ) اے پروردگار، ہم سے یہ خدمت قبول فرما۔ بےشک تو سننے والا (اور) جاننے والا ہے",
        "اے پروردگار، ہم کو اپنا فرمانبردار بنائے رکھیو۔ اور ہماری اولاد میں سے بھی ایک گروہ کو اپنا مطیع بنائے رہیو، اور (پروردگار) ہمیں طریق عبادت بتا اور ہمارے حال پر (رحم کے ساتھ) توجہ فرما۔ بے شک تو توجہ فرمانے والا مہربان ہے",
        "اے پروردگار، ان (لوگوں) میں انہیں میں سے ایک پیغمبر مبعوث کیجیو جو ان کو تیری آیتیں پڑھ پڑھ کر سنایا کرے اور کتاب اور دانائی سکھایا کرے اور ان (کے دلوں) کو پاک صاف کیا کرے۔ بےشک تو غالب اور صاحبِ حکمت ہے",
        "اور ابراہیم کے دین سے کون رو گردانی کر سکتا ہے، بجز اس کے جو نہایت نادان ہو۔ ہم نے ان کو دنیا میں بھی منتخب کیا تھا اور آخرت میں بھی وہ (زمرہٴ) صلحا میں سے ہوں گے",
        "جب ان سے ان کے پروردگار نے فرمایا کہ اسلام لے آؤ تو انہوں نے عرض کی کہ میں رب العالمین کے آگے سر اطاعت خم کرتا ہوں",
        "اور ابرہیم نے اپنے بیٹوں کو اسی بات کی وصیت کی اور یعقوب نے بھی (اپنے فرزندوں سے یہی کہا) کہ بیٹا خدا نے تمہارے لیے یہی دین پسند فرمایا ہے تو مرنا ہے تو مسلمان ہی مرنا",
        "بھلا جس وقت یعقوب وفات پانے لگے تو تم اس وقت موجود تھے، جب انہوں نے اپنے بیٹوں سے پوچھا کہ میرے بعد تم کس کی عبادت کرو گے، تو انہوں نے کہا کہ آپ کے معبود اور آپ کے باپ دادا ابراہیم اور اسمٰعیل اور اسحاق کے معبود کی عبادت کریں گے جو معبود یکتا ہے اور ہم اُسی کے حکم بردار ہیں",
        "یہ جماعت گزرچکی۔ ان کو اُن کے اعمال (کا بدلہ ملے گا) اور تم کو تمھارے اعمال (کا) اور جو عمل وہ کرتے تھے ان کی پرسش تم سے نہیں ہوگی",
        "اور (یہودی اور عیسائی) کہتے ہیں کہ یہودی یا عیسائی ہو جاؤ تو سیدھے رستے پر لگ جاؤ۔ (اے پیغمبر ان سے) کہہ دو، (نہیں) بلکہ (ہم) دین ابراہیم (اختیار کئے ہوئے ہیں) جو ایک خدا کے ہو رہے تھے اور مشرکوں میں سے نہ تھے",
        "(مسلمانو) کہو کہ ہم خدا پر ایمان لائے اور جو (کتاب) ہم پر اتری، اس پر اور جو (صحیفے) ابراہیم اور اسمٰعیل اور اسحاق اور یعقوب اور ان کی اولاد پر نازل ہوئے ان پر اور جو (کتابیں) موسیٰ اور عیسی کو عطا ہوئیں، ان پر، اور جو اور پیغمبروں کو ان کے پروردگار کی طرف سے ملیں، ان پر (سب پر ایمان لائے) ہم ان پیغمروں میں سے کسی میں کچھ فرق نہیں کرتے اور ہم اسی (خدائے واحد) کے فرمانبردار ہیں",
        "تو اگر یہ لوگ بھی اسی طرح ایمان لے آئیں جس طرح تم ایمان لے آئے ہو تو ہدایت یاب ہو جائیں اور اگر منہ پھیر لیں (اور نہ مانیں) تو وہ (تمھارے) مخالف ہیں اور ان کے مقابلے میں تمھیں خدا کافی ہے۔ اور وہ سننے والا (اور) جاننے والا ہے",
        "(کہہ دو کہ ہم نے) خدا کا رنگ (اختیار کر لیا ہے) اور خدا سے بہتر رنگ کس کا ہو سکتا ہے۔ اور ہم اسی کی عبادت کرنے والے ہیں",
        "(ان سے) کہو، کیا تم خدا کے بارے میں ہم سے جھگڑتے ہو، حالانکہ وہی ہمارا اور تمھارا پروردگار ہے اور ہم کو ہمارے اعمال (کا بدلہ ملے گا) اور تم کو تمھارے اعمال (کا) اور ہم خاص اسی کی عبادت کرنے والے ہیں",
        "(اے یہود ونصاریٰ) کیا تم اس بات کے قائل ہو کہ ابراہیم اور اسمٰعیل اور اسحاق اور یعقوب اور ان کی اولاد یہودی یا عیسائی تھے۔ (اے محمدﷺ ان سے) کہو کہ بھلا تم زیادہ جانتے ہو یا خدا؟ اور اس سے بڑھ کر ظالم کون، جو خدا کی شہادت کو، جو اس کے پاس (کتاب میں موجود) ہے چھپائے۔ اور جو کچھ تم کر رہے ہو، خدا اس سے غافل نہیں",
        "یہ جماعت گزر چکی۔ ان کو وہ (ملے گا) جو انہوں نے کیا، اور تم کو وہ جو تم نے کیا۔ اور جو عمل وہ کرتے تھے، اس کی پرسش تم سے نہیں ہوگی",
        "احمق لوگ کہیں گے کہ مسلمان جس قبلے پر (پہلے سے چلے آتے) تھے (اب) اس سے کیوں منہ پھیر بیٹھے۔ تم کہہ دو کہ مشرق اور مغرب سب خدا ہی کا ہے۔ وہ جس کو چاہتا ہے، سیدھے رستے پر چلاتا ہے",
        "اور اسی طرح ہم نے تم کو امتِ معتدل بنایا ہے، تاکہ تم لوگوں پر گواہ بنو اور پیغمبر (آخرالزماں) تم پر گواہ بنیں۔ اور جس قبلے پر تم (پہلے) تھے، اس کو ہم نے اس لیے مقرر کیا تھا کہ معلوم کریں، کون (ہمارے) پیغمبر کا تابع رہتا ہے، اور کون الٹے پاؤں پھر جاتا ہے۔ اور یہ بات (یعنی تحویل قبلہ لوگوں کو) گراں معلوم ہوئی، مگر جن کو خدا نے ہدایت بخشی (وہ اسے گراں نہیں سمجھتے) اور خدا ایسا نہیں کہ تمہارے ایمان کو یونہی کھو دے۔ خدا تو لوگوں پر بڑا مہربان (اور) صاحبِ رحمت ہے",
        "(اے محمدﷺ) ہم تمہارا آسمان کی طرف منہ پھیر پھیر کر دیکھنا دیکھ رہے ہیں۔ سو ہم تم کو اسی قبلے کی طرف جس کو تم پسند کرتے ہو، منہ کرنے کا حکم دیں گے تو اپنا منہ مسجد حرام (یعنی خانہٴ کعبہ) کی طرف پھیر لو۔ اور تم لوگ جہاں ہوا کرو، (نماز پڑھنے کے وقت) اسی مسجد کی طرف منہ کر لیا کرو۔ اور جن لوگوں کو کتاب دی گئی ہے، وہ خوب جانتے ہیں کہ (نیا قبلہ) ان کے پروردگار کی طرف سے حق ہے۔ اور جو کام یہ لوگ کرتے ہیں، خدا ان سے بے خبر نہیں",
        "اور اگر تم ان اہلِ کتاب کے پاس تمام نشانیاں بھی لے کر آؤ، تو بھی یہ تمہارے قبلے کی پیروی نہ کریں۔ اور تم بھی ان کے قبلے کی پیروی کرنے والے نہیں ہو۔ اور ان میں سے بھی بعض بعض کے قبلے کے پیرو نہیں۔ اور اگر تم باوجود اس کے کہ تمہارے پاس دانش (یعنی وحئ خدا) آ چکی ہے، ان کی خواہشوں کے پیچھے چلو گے تو ظالموں میں (داخل) ہو جاؤ گے",
        "جن لوگوں کو ہم نے کتاب دی ہے، وہ ان (پیغمبر آخرالزماں) کو اس طرح پہچانتے ہیں، جس طرح اپنے بیٹوں کو پہچانا کرتے ہیں، مگر ایک فریق ان میں سے سچی بات کو جان بوجھ کر چھپا رہا ہے",

        "یہ پیغمبر (جو ہم وقتاً فوقتاً بھیجتے رہیں ہیں) ان میں سے ہم نے بعض کو بعض پر فضیلت دی ہے۔ بعض ایسے ہیں جن سے خدا نے گفتگو فرمائی اور بعض کے (دوسرے امور میں) مرتبے بلند کئے۔ اور عیسیٰ بن مریم کو ہم نے کھلی ہوئی نشانیاں عطا کیں اور روح القدس سے ان کو مدد دی۔ اور اگر خداچاہتا تو ان سے پچھلے لوگ اپنے پاس کھلی نشانیاں آنے کے بعد آپس میں نہ لڑتے لیکن انہوں نے اختلاف کیا تو ان میں سے بعض تو ایمان لے آئے اور بعض کافر ہی رہے۔ اور اگر خدا چاہتا تو یہ لوگ باہم جنگ و قتال نہ کرتے۔ لیکن خدا جو چاہتا ہے کرتا ہے",
        "اے ایمان والو جو (مال) ہم نے تم کو دیا ہے اس میں سے اس دن کے آنے سے پہلے پہلے خرچ کرلو جس میں نہ (اعمال کا) سودا ہو اور نہ دوستی اور سفارش ہو سکے اور کفر کرنے والے لوگ ظالم ہیں",
        "خدا (وہ معبود برحق ہے کہ) اس کے سوا کوئی عبادت کے لائق نہیں زندہ ہمیشہ رہنے والا اسے نہ اونگھ آتی ہے نہ نیند جو کچھ آسمانوں میں اور جو کچھ زمین میں ہیں سب اسی کا ہے کون ہے جو اس کی اجازت کے بغیر اس سے (کسی کی) سفارش کر سکے جو کچھ لوگوں کے روبرو ہو رہا ہے اور جو کچھ ان کے پیچھے ہوچکا ہے اسے سب معلوم ہے اور وہ اس کی معلومات میں سے کسی چیز پر دسترس حاصل نہیں کر سکتے ہاں جس قدر وہ چاہتا ہے (اسی قدر معلوم کرا دیتا ہے) اس کی بادشاہی (اور علم) آسمان اور زمین سب پر حاوی ہے اور اسے ان کی حفاظت کچھ بھی دشوار نہیں وہ بڑا عالی رتبہ اور جلیل القدر ہے",
        "دین (اسلام) میں زبردستی نہیں ہے ہدایت (صاف طور پر ظاہر اور) گمراہی سے الگ ہو چکی ہے تو جو شخص بتوں سے اعتقاد نہ رکھے اور خدا پر ایمان لائے اس نے ایسی مضبوط رسی ہاتھ میں پکڑ لی ہے جو کبھی ٹوٹنے والی نہیں اور خدا (سب کچھ) سنتا اور (سب کچھ) جانتا ہے",
        "جو لوگ ایمان لائے ہیں ان کا دوست خدا ہے کہ اُن کو اندھیرے سے نکال کر روشنی میں لے جاتا ہے اور جو کافر ہیں ان کے دوست شیطان ہیں کہ ان کو روشنی سے نکال کر اندھیرے میں لے جاتے ہیں یہی لوگ اہل دوزخ ہیں کہ اس میں ہمیشہ رہیں گے",
        "بھلا تم نے اس شخص کو نہیں دیکھا جو اس (غرور کے) سبب سے کہ خدا نے اس کو سلطنت بخشی تھی ابراہیم سے پروردگار کے بارے میں جھگڑنے لگا۔ جب ابراہیم نے کہا میرا پروردگار تو وہ ہے جو جلاتا اور مارتا ہے۔ وہ بولا کہ جلا اور مار تو میں بھی سکتا ہوں۔ ابراہیم نے کہا کہ خدا تو سورج کو مشرق سے نکالتا ہے آپ اسے مغرب سے نکال دیجیئے (یہ سن کر) کافر حیران رہ گیا اور خدا بےانصافوں کو ہدایت نہیں دیا کرتا",
        "یا اسی طرح اس شخص کو (نہیں دیکھا) جسے ایک گاؤں میں جو اپنی چھتوں پر گرا پڑا تھا اتفاق گزر ہوا۔ تو اس نے کہا کہ خدا اس (کے باشندوں) کو مرنے کے بعد کیونکر زندہ کرے گا۔ تو خدا نے اس کی روح قبض کرلی (اور) سو برس تک (اس کو مردہ رکھا) پھر اس کو جلا اٹھایا اور پوچھا تم کتنا عرصہ (مرے)رہے ہو اس نے جواب دیا کہ ایک دن یا اس سے بھی کم۔ خدا نے فرمایا (نہیں) بلکہ سو برس (مرے) رہے ہو۔ اور اپنے کھانے پینے کی چیزوں کو دیکھو کہ (اتنی مدت میں مطلق) سڑی بسی نہیں اور اپنے گدھے کو بھی دیکھو (جو مرا پڑا ہے) غرض (ان باتوں سے) یہ ہے کہ ہم تم کو لوگوں کے لئے (اپنی قدرت کی) نشانی بنائیں اور (ہاں گدھے) کی ہڈیوں کو دیکھو کہ ہم ان کو کیونکر جوڑے دیتے اور ان پر (کس طرح) گوشت پوست چڑھا دیتے ہیں۔ جب یہ واقعات اس کے مشاہدے میں آئے تو بول اٹھا کہ میں یقین کرتا ہوں کہ خدا ہر چیز پر قادر ہے",
        "اور جب ابراہیم نے (خدا سے) کہا کہ اے پروردگار مجھے دکھا کہ تو مردوں کو کیونکر زندہ کرے گا۔ خدا نے فرمایا کیا تم نے (اس بات کو) باور نہیں کیا۔ انہوں نے کہا کیوں نہیں۔ لیکن (میں دیکھنا) اس لئے (چاہتا ہوں) کہ میرا دل اطمینان کامل حاصل کرلے۔ خدا نے فرمایا کہ چار جانور پکڑوا کر اپنے پاس منگا لو (اور ٹکڑے ٹکڑے کرادو) پھر ان کا ایک ٹکڑا ہر ایک پہاڑ پر رکھوا دو پھر ان کو بلاؤ تو وہ تمہارے پاس دوڑتے چلے آئیں گے۔ اور جان رکھو کہ خدا غالب اور صاحب حکمت ہے۔",
        "جو لوگ اپنا مال خدا کی راہ میں خرچ کرتے ہیں ان (کے مال) کی مثال اس دانے کی سی ہے جس سے سات بالیں اگیں اور ہر ایک بال میں سو سو دانے ہوں اور خدا جس (کے مال) کو چاہتا ہے زیادہ کرتا ہے۔ وہ بڑی کشائش والا اور سب کچھ جاننے والا ہے",
        "جو لوگ اپنا مال خدا کے رستے میں صرف کرتے ہیں پھر اس کے بعد نہ اس خرچ کا (کسی پر) احسان رکھتے ہیں اور نہ (کسی کو) تکلیف دیتے ہیں۔ ان کا صلہ ان کے پروردگار کے پاس (تیار) ہے۔ اور (قیامت کے روز) نہ ان کو کچھ خوف ہوگا اور نہ وہ غمگین ہوں گے",
        "جس خیرات دینے کے بعد (لینے والے کو) ایذا دی جائے اس سے تو نرم بات کہہ دینی اور (اس کی بے ادبی سے) درگزر کرنا بہتر ہے اور خدا بےپروا اور بردبار ہے",
        "مومنو! اپنے صدقات (وخیرات)احسان رکھنے اور ایذا دینے سے اس شخص کی طرح برباد نہ کردینا۔ جو لوگوں کو دکھاوے کے لئے مال خرچ کرتا ہے اور خدا اور روز آخرت پر ایمان نہیں رکھتا۔ تو اس (کے مال) کی مثال اس چٹان کی سی ہے جس پر تھوڑی سی مٹی پڑی ہو اور اس پر زور کا مینہ برس کر اسے صاف کر ڈالے۔ (اسی طرح) یہ (ریاکار) لوگ اپنے اعمال کا کچھ بھی صلہ حاصل نہیں کرسکیں گے۔ اور خدا ایسے ناشکروں کو ہدایت نہیں دیا کرتا",
        "اور جو لوگ خدا کی خوشنودی حاصل کرنے کے لئے خلوص نیت سے اپنا مال خرچ کرتے ہیں ان کی مثال ایک باغ کی سی ہے جو اونچی جگہ پر واقع ہو(جب) اس پر مینہ پڑے تو دگنا پھل لائے۔ اور اگر مینہ نہ بھی پڑے تو خیر پھوار ہی سہی اور خدا تمہارے کاموں کو دیکھ رہا ہے",
        "بھلا تم میں کوئی یہ چاہتا ہے کہ اس کا کھجوروں اور انگوروں کا باغ ہو جس میں نہریں بہہ رہی ہوں اور اس میں اس کے لئے ہر قسم کے میوے موجود ہوں اور اسے بڑھاپا آپکڑے اور اس کے ننھے ننھے بچے بھی ہوں۔ تو (ناگہاں) اس باغ پر آگ کا بھرا ہوا بگولا چلے اور وہ جل کر (راکھ کا ڈھیر ہو) جائے۔ اس طرح خدا تم سے اپنی آیتیں کھول کھول کر بیان فرماتا ہے تاکہ تم سوچو (اور سمجھو)",
        "مومنو! جو پاکیزہ اور عمدہ مال تم کماتے ہوں اور جو چیزیں ہم تمہارے لئے زمین سےنکالتے ہیں ان میں سے (راہ خدا میں) خرچ کرو۔ اور بری اور ناپاک چیزیں دینے کا قصد نہ کرنا کہ (اگر وہ چیزیں تمہیں دی جائیں تو) بجز اس کے کہ (لیتے وقت) آنکھیں بند کرلو ان کو کبھی نہ لو۔ اور جان رکھو کہ خدا بےپروا (اور) قابل ستائش ہے",
        "(اور دیکھنا) شیطان (کا کہنا نہ ماننا وہ) تمہیں تنگ دستی کا خوف دلاتا اور بےحیائی کے کام کر نے کو کہتا ہے۔ اور خدا تم سے اپنی بخشش اور رحمت کا وعدہ کرتا ہے۔ اور خدا بڑی کشائش والا (اور) سب کچھ جاننے والا ہے",
        "وہ جس کو چاہتا ہے دانائی بخشتا ہے۔ اور جس کو دانائی ملی بےشک اس کو بڑی نعمت ملی۔ اور نصیحت تو وہی لوگ قبول کرتے ہیں جو عقلمند ہیں",
        "اور تم (خدا کی راہ میں) جس طرح کا خرچ کرو یا کوئی نذر مانو خدا اس کو جانتا ہے اور ظالموں کا کوئی مددگار نہیں",
        "اگر تم خیرات ظاہر دو تو وہ بھی خوب ہے اور اگر پوشیدہ دو اور دو بھی اہل حاجت کو تو وہ خوب تر ہے اور (اس طرح کا دینا) تمہارے گناہوں کو بھی دور کردے گا۔ اور خدا کو تمہارے سب کاموں کی خبر ہے",
        "(اے محمدﷺ) تم ان لوگوں کی ہدایت کے ذمہ دار نہیں ہو بلکہ خدا ہی جس کو چاہتا ہے ہدایت بخشتا ہے۔ اور (مومنو) تم جو مال خرچ کرو گے تو اس کا فائدہ تمہیں کو ہے اور تم جو خرچ کرو گے خدا کی خوشنودی کے لئے کرو گے۔ اور جو مال تم خرچ کرو گے وہ تمہیں پورا پورا دے دیا جائے گا اور تمہارا کچھ نقصان نہیں کیا جائے گا،",
        "(اور ہاں تم جو خرچ کرو گے تو) ان حاجتمندوں کے لئے جو خدا کی راہ میں رکے بیٹھے ہیں اور ملک میں کسی طرف جانے کی طاقت نہیں رکھتے (اور مانگنے سے عار رکھتے ہیں) یہاں تک کہ نہ مانگنے کی وجہ سے ناواقف شخص ان کو غنی خیال کرتا ہے اور تم قیافے سے ان کو صاف پہچان لو (کہ حاجتمند ہیں اور شرم کے سبب) لوگوں سے (منہ پھوڑ کر اور) لپٹ کر نہیں مانگ سکتے اور تم جو مال خرچ کرو گے کچھ شک نہیں کہ خدا اس کو جانتا ہے",
        "جو لوگ اپنا مال رات اور دن اور پوشیدہ اور ظاہر (راہ خدا میں) خرچ کرتے رہتے ہیں ان کا صلہ پروردگار کے پاس ہے اور ان کو (قیامت کے دن) نہ کسی طرح کا خوف ہوگا اور نہ غم",
        "جو لوگ سود کھاتے ہیں وہ (قبروں سے) اس طرح (حواس باختہ) اٹھیں گے جیسے کسی کو جن نے لپٹ کر دیوانہ بنا دیا ہو یہ اس لئے کہ وہ کہتے ہیں کہ سودا بیچنا بھی تو (نفع کے لحاظ سے) ویسا ہی ہے جیسے سود (لینا) حالانکہ سودے کو خدا نے حلال کیا ہے اور سود کو حرام۔ تو جس شخص کے پاس خدا کی نصیحت پہنچی اور وہ (سود لینے سے) باز آگیا تو جو پہلے ہوچکا وہ اس کا۔ اور (قیامت میں) اس کا معاملہ خدا کے سپرد اور جو پھر لینے لگا تو ایسے لوگ دوزخی ہیں کہ ہمیشہ دوزخ میں (جلتے) رہیں گے",
        "خدا سود کو نابود (یعنی بےبرکت) کرتا اور خیرات (کی برکت) کو بڑھاتا ہے اور خدا کسی ناشکرے گنہگار کو دوست نہیں رکھتا",
        "جو لوگ ایمان لائے اور نیک عمل کرتے اور نماز پڑھتے اور زکوٰة دیتے رہے ان کو ان کے کاموں کا صلہ خدا کے ہاں ملے گا اور (قیامت کے دن) ان کو نہ کچھ خوف ہوا اور نہ وہ غمناک ہوں گے",
        "مومنو! خدا سے ڈرو اور اگر ایمان رکھتے ہو تو جتنا سود باقی رہ گیا ہے اس کو چھوڑ دو",
        "اگر ایسا نہ کرو گے تو خبردار ہوجاؤ (کہ تم) خدا اور رسول سے جنگ کرنے کے لئے (تیار ہوتے ہو) اور اگر توبہ کرلو گے (اور سود چھوڑ دو گے) تو تم کو اپنی اصل رقم لینے کا حق ہے جس میں نہ اوروں کا نقصان اور تمہارا نقصان",
        "اور اگر قرض لینے والا تنگ دست ہو تو (اسے) کشائش (کے حاصل ہونے) تک مہلت (دو) اور اگر (زر قرض) بخش ہی دو توتمہارے لئے زیادہ اچھا ہے بشرطیکہ سمجھو",
        "اور اس دن سے ڈرو جب کہ تم خدا کے حضور میں لوٹ کر جاؤ گے اور ہر شخص اپنے اعمال کا پورا پورا بدلہ پائے گا۔ اور کسی کا کچھ نقصان نہ ہوگا",
        "مومنو! جب تم آپس میں کسی میعاد معین کے لئے قرض کا معاملہ کرنے لگو تو اس کو لکھ لیا کرو اور لکھنے والا تم میں (کسی کا نقصان نہ کرے بلکہ) انصاف سے لکھے نیز لکھنے والا جیسا اسے خدا نے سکھایا ہے لکھنے سے انکار بھی نہ کرے اور دستاویز لکھ دے۔ اور جو شخص قرض لے وہی (دستاویز کا) مضمون بول کر لکھوائے اور خدا سے کہ اس کا مالک ہے خوف کرے اور زر قرض میں سے کچھ کم نہ لکھوائے۔ اور اگر قرض لینے والا بےعقل یا ضعیف ہو یا مضمون لکھوانے کی قابلیت نہ رکھتا ہو تو جو اس کا ولی ہو وہ انصاف کے ساتھ مضمون لکھوائے۔ اور اپنے میں سے دو مردوں کو (ایسے معاملے کے) گواہ کرلیا کرو۔ اور اگر دو مرد نہ ہوں تو ایک مرد اور دو عورتیں جن کو تم گواہ پسند کرو (کافی ہیں) کہ اگر ان میں سے ایک بھول جائے گی تو دوسری اسے یاد دلادے گی۔ اور جب گواہ (گواہی کے لئے طلب کئے جائیں تو انکار نہ کریں۔ اور قرض تھوڑا ہو یا بہت اس (کی دستاویز) کے لکھنے میں کاہلی نہ کرنا۔ یہ بات خدا کے نزدیک نہایت قرین انصاف ہے اور شہادت کے لئے بھی یہ بہت درست طریقہ ہے۔ اس سے تمہیں کسی طرح کا شک وہ شبہ بھی نہیں پڑے گا۔ ہاں اگر سودا دست بدست ہو جو تم آپس میں لیتے دیتے ہو تو اگر (ایسے معاملے کی) دستاویز نہ لکھوتو تم پر کچھ گناہ نہیں۔ اور جب خرید وفروخت کیا کرو تو بھی گواہ کرلیا کرو۔ اور کاتب دستاویز اور گواہ (معاملہ کرنے والوں کا) کسی طرح نقصان نہ کریں۔ اگر تم (لوگ) ایسا کرو تو یہ تمہارے لئے گناہ کی بات ہے۔ اور خدا سے ڈرو اور (دیکھو کہ) وہ تم کو (کیسی مفید باتیں) سکھاتا ہے اور خدا ہر چیز سے واقف ہے",
        "اور اگر تم سفر پر ہواور (دستاویز) لکھنے والا مل نہ سکے تو (کوئی چیز) رہن یا قبضہ رکھ کر (قرض لے لو) اور اگر کوئی کسی کو امین سمجھے (یعنی رہن کے بغیر قرض دیدے) تو امانتدار کو چاہیئے کہ صاحب امانت کی امانت ادا کردے اور خدا سے جو اس کا پروردگار ہے ڈرے۔اور (دیکھنا) شہادت کو مت چھپانا۔ جو اس کو چھپائے گا وہ دل کا گنہگار ہوگا۔ اور خدا تمہارے سب کاموں سے واقف ہے",
        "جو کچھ آسمانوں میں اور جو کچھ زمین میں ہے سب خدا ہی کا ہے۔ تم اپنے دلوں کی بات کو ظاہر کرو گے تو یا چھپاؤ گے تو خدا تم سے اس کا حساب لے گا پھر وہ جسے چاہے مغفرت کرے اور جسے چاہے عذاب دے۔ اور خدا ہر چیز پر قادر ہے",
        "رسول (خدا) اس کتاب پر جو ان کے پروردگار کی طرف سے ان پر نازل ہوئی ایمان رکھتے ہیں اور مومن بھی۔ سب خدا پر اور اس کے فرشتوں پر اور اس کی کتابوں پر اور اس کے پیغمبروں پر ایمان رکھتے ہیں (اورکہتے ہیں کہ) ہم اس کے پیغمبروں سے کسی میں کچھ فرق نہیں کرتے اور وہ (خدا سے) عرض کرتے ہیں کہ ہم نے (تیرا حکم) سنا اور قبول کیا۔ اے پروردگار ہم تیری بخشش مانگتے ہیں اور تیری ہی طرف لوٹ کر جانا ہے",
