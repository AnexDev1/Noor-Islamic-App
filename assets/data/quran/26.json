        "These are the verses of the clear Book.",
        "Perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their disbelief.",
        "If We willed, We could send down upon them a ˹compelling˺ sign from the heavens, leaving their necks bent in ˹utter˺ submission to it.",
        "Whatever new reminder comes to them from the Most Compassionate, they always turn away from it.",
        "They have certainly denied ˹the truth˺, so they will soon face the consequences of their ridicule.",
        "Have they failed to look at the earth, ˹to see˺ how many types of fine plants We have caused to grow in it?",
        "Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe.",
        "And your Lord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful.",
        "˹Remember˺ when your Lord called out to Moses, “Go to the wrongdoing people—",
        "the people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear ˹Allah˺?”",
        "He replied, “My Lord! I fear that they will reject me.",
        "And ˹so˺ my heart will be broken and my tongue will be tied. So send Aaron along ˹as a messenger˺.",
        "Also, they have a charge against me, so I fear they may kill me.”",
        "Allah responded, “Certainly not! So go, both of you, with Our signs. We will be with you, listening.",
        "Go to Pharaoh and say, ‘We are messengers from the Lord of all worlds",
        "˹commanded to say:˺ ‘Let the Children of Israel go with us.’’”",
        "Pharaoh protested, “Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you stayed several years of your life in our care?",
        "Then you did what you did, being ˹utterly˺ ungrateful!”",
        "Moses replied, “I did it then, lacking guidance.",
        "So I fled from you when I feared you. Then my Lord granted me wisdom and made me one of the messengers.",
        "How can that be a ‘favour,’ of which you remind me, when ˹it was only because˺ you ˹have˺ enslaved the Children of Israel?”",
        "Pharaoh asked, “And what is ‘the Lord of all worlds’?”",
        "Moses replied, “˹He is˺ the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, if only you had sure faith.”",
        "Pharaoh said to those around him, “Did you hear ˹what he said˺?”",
        "Moses added, “˹He is˺ your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers.”",
        "Pharaoh said ˹mockingly˺, “Your messenger, who has been sent to you, must be insane.”",
        "Moses responded: “˹He is˺ the Lord of the east and west, and everything in between, if only you had any sense.”",
        "Pharaoh threatened, “If you take any other god besides me, I will certainly have you imprisoned.”",
        "Moses responded, “Even if I bring you a clear proof?”",
        "Pharaoh demanded, “Bring it then, if what you say is true.”",
        "So he threw down his staff and—behold!—it became a real snake.",
        "Then he drew his hand ˹out of his collar˺ and it was ˹shining˺ white for all to see.",
        "Pharaoh said to the chiefs around him, “He is indeed a skilled magician",
        "who seeks to drive you from your land by his magic. So what do you propose?”",
        "They replied, “Let him and his brother wait and dispatch mobilizers to all cities",
        "to bring you every skilled magician.”",
        "So the magicians were assembled at the set time on the appointed day.",
        "And the people were asked, “Will you join the gathering",

        "He replied, “Yes, and you will then certainly be among those closest to me.”",
        "Moses said to them, “Cast whatever you wish to cast.”",
        "So they cast down their ropes and staffs, saying, “By Pharaoh’s might, it is we who will surely prevail.”",
        "Then Moses threw down his staff, and—behold!—it devoured the objects of their illusion!",
        "So the magicians fell down, prostrating.",
        "They declared, “We ˹now˺ believe in the Lord of all worlds—",
        "the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”",
        "Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught you magic, but soon you will see. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”",
        "They responded, “˹That would be˺ no harm! Surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return.",
        "We really hope that our Lord will forgive our sins, as we are the first to believe.”",
        "And We inspired Moses, ˹saying,˺ “Leave with My servants at night, for you will surely be pursued.”",
        "Then Pharaoh sent mobilizers to all cities",
        "˹and said,˺ “These ˹outcasts˺ are just a handful of people",
        "who have really enraged us",
        "but we are all on the alert.”",
        "So We lured the tyrants out of ˹their˺ gardens, springs",
        "treasures, and splendid residences.",
        "So it was. And We awarded it ˹all˺ to the Children of Israel.",
        "And so they pursued them at sunrise.",
        "When the two groups came face to face, the companions of Moses cried out, “We are overtaken for sure.”",
        "Moses reassured ˹them˺, “Absolutely not! My Lord is certainly with me—He will guide me.”",
        "So We inspired Moses: “Strike the sea with your staff,” and the sea was split, each part was like a huge mountain.",
        "We drew the pursuers to that place",
        "and delivered Moses and those with him all together.",
        "Then We drowned the others.",
        "Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe.",

        "They replied, “We worship idols, to which we are fully devoted.”",
        "Abraham asked, “Can they hear you when you call upon them?",
        "Or can they benefit or harm you?”",
        "They replied, “No! But we found our forefathers doing the same.”",
        "Abraham responded, “Have you ˹really˺ considered what you have been worshipping—",
        "you and your ancestors?",
        "They are ˹all˺ enemies to me, except the Lord of all worlds.",
        "˹He is˺ the One Who created me, and He ˹alone˺ guides me.",
        "˹He is˺ the One Who provides me with food and drink.",
        "And He ˹alone˺ heals me when I am sick.",
        "And He ˹is the One Who˺ will cause me to die, and then bring me back to life.",
        "And He is ˹the One˺ Who, I hope, will forgive my flaws on Judgment Day.”",
        "“My Lord! Grant me wisdom, and join me with the righteous.",
        "Bless me with honourable mention among later generations.",
        "Make me one of those awarded the Garden of Bliss.",
        "Forgive my father, for he is certainly one of the misguided.",
        "And do not disgrace me on the Day all will be resurrected—",
        "the Day when neither wealth nor children will be of any benefit.",
        "Only those who come before Allah with a pure heart ˹will be saved˺.”",
        "˹On that Day˺ Paradise will be brought near to the God-fearing",
        "and the Hellfire will be displayed to the deviant.",
        "And it will be said to them, “Where are those you used to worship",
        "besides Allah? Can they help you or even help themselves?”",
        "Then the idols will be hurled headlong into Hell, along with the deviant",
        "and the soldiers of Iblîs, all together.",
        "There the deviant will cry while disputing with their idols",
        "“By Allah! We were clearly mistaken",
        "when we made you equal to the Lord of all worlds.",
        "And none led us astray other than the wicked.",
        "Now we have none to intercede for us",
        "nor a close friend.",
        "If only we could have a second chance, then we would be believers.”",

        "So fear Allah, and obey me.”",
        "They argued, “How can we believe in you, when you are followed ˹only˺ by the lowest of the low?”",
        "He responded, “And what knowledge do I have of what they do?",
        "Their judgment is with my Lord, if you had any sense!",
        "I am not going to expel the believers.",

        "Noah prayed, “My Lord! My people have truly rejected me.",
        "So judge between me and them decisively, and save me and the believers with me.”",
        "So We saved him and those with him in the fully loaded Ark.",

        "So fear Allah, and obey me.",

        "You are only a human being like us, so bring forth a sign if what you say is true.”",
        "Ṣâliḥ said, “Here is a camel. She will have her turn to drink as you have yours, each on an appointed day.",
        "And do not ever touch her with harm, or you will be overtaken by the torment of a tremendous day.”",
        "But they killed her, becoming regretful.",

        "My Lord! Save me and my family from ˹the consequences of˺ what they do.”",
        "So We saved him and all of his family",
        "except an old woman, who was one of the doomed.",
        "Then We utterly destroyed the rest",
        "pouring upon them a rain ˹of brimstone˺. How evil was the rain of those who had been warned!",

        "Shu’aib responded, “My Lord knows best whatever you do.”",
        "So they rejected him, and ˹so˺ were overtaken by the torment of the day of the ˹deadly˺ cloud. That was really a torment of a tremendous day.",

        "And your Lord is certainly the Almighty, Most Merciful.",
        "This is certainly a revelation from the Lord of all worlds",

        "in a clear Arabic tongue.",
        "And it has indeed been ˹foretold˺ in the Scriptures of those before.",
        "Was it not sufficient proof for the deniers that it has been recognized by the knowledgeable among the Children of Israel?",

        "then there came to them what they had been threatened with:",
        "would that enjoyment be of any benefit to them ˹at all˺?",
        "We have never destroyed a society without warners",
        "to remind ˹them˺, for We would never wrong ˹anyone˺.",
        "It was not the devils who brought this ˹Quran˺ down:",
        "it is not for them ˹to do so˺, nor can they",
        "for they are strictly barred from ˹even˺ overhearing ˹it˺.",
        "So do not ever call upon any other god besides Allah, or you will be one of the punished.",
        "And warn ˹all, starting with˺ your closest relatives",
        "and be gracious to the believers who follow you.",
        "But if they disobey you, say, “I am certainly free of what you do.”",
        "Put your trust in the Almighty, Most Merciful",
        "Who sees you when you rise ˹for prayer at night˺",

        "As for poets, they are followed ˹merely˺ by deviants.",
        "Do you not see how they rant in every field",
        "only saying what they never do?",
        "Except those who believe, do good, remember Allah often, and ˹poetically˺ avenge ˹the believers˺ after being wrongfully slandered. The wrongdoers will come to know what ˹evil˺ end they will meet."

        "اور اگر سچے ہو تو ہم پر آسمان سے ایک ٹکڑا لا کر گراؤ",
        "شعیب نے کہا کہ جو کام تم کرتے ہو میرا پروردگار اس سے خوب واقف ہے",
        "تو ان لوگوں نے ان کو جھٹلایا، پس سائبان کے عذاب نے ان کو آ پکڑا۔ بےشک وہ بڑے (سخت) دن کا عذاب تھا",
        "اس میں یقیناً نشانی ہے۔ اور ان میں اکثر ایمان لانے والے نہیں تھے",
        "اور تمہارا پروردگار تو غالب (اور) مہربان ہے",
        "اور یہ قرآن (خدائے) پروردگار عالم کا اُتارا ہوا ہے",
        "اس کو امانت دار فرشتہ لے کر اُترا ہے",
        "(یعنی اس نے) تمہارے دل پر (القا) کیا ہے تاکہ (لوگوں کو) نصیحت کرتے رہو",
        "اور (القا بھی) فصیح عربی زبان میں (کیا ہے)",
        "اور اس کی خبر پہلے پیغمبروں کی کتابوں میں (لکھی ہوئی) ہے",
        "کیا ان کے لئے یہ سند نہیں ہے کہ علمائے بنی اسرائیل اس (بات) کو جانتے ہیں",
        "اور اگر ہم اس کو کسی غیر اہل زبان پر اُتارتے",
        "اور وہ اسے ان (لوگوں کو) پڑھ کر سناتا تو یہ اسے (کبھی) نہ مانتے",
        "اسی طرح ہم نے انکار کو گنہگاروں کے دلوں میں داخل کردیا",
        "وہ جب تک درد دینے والا عذاب نہ دیکھ لیں گے، اس کو نہیں مانیں گے",
        "وہ ان پر ناگہاں آ واقع ہوگا اور انہیں خبر بھی نہ ہوگی",
        "اس وقت کہیں گے کیا ہمیں ملہت ملے گی؟",
        "تو کیا یہ ہمارے عذاب کو جلدی طلب کر رہے ہیں",
        "بھلا دیکھو تو اگر ہم ان کو برسوں فائدے دیتے رہے",
        "پھر ان پر وہ (عذاب) آ واقع ہو جس کا تم سے وعدہ کیا جاتا ہے",
        "تو جو فائدے یہ اٹھاتے رہے ان کے کس کام آئیں گے",
        "اور ہم نے کوئی بستی ہلاک نہیں کی مگر اس کے لئے نصیحت کرنے والے (پہلے بھیج دیتے) تھے",
        "نصیحت کردیں اور ہم ظالم نہیں ہیں",
        "اور اس (قرآن) کو شیطان لے کر نازل نہیں ہوئے",
        "یہ کام نہ تو ان کو سزاوار ہے اور نہ وہ اس کی طاقت رکھتے ہیں",
        "وہ (آسمانی باتوں) کے سننے (کے مقامات) سے الگ کر دیئے گئے ہیں",
        "تو خدا کے سوا کسی اور معبود کو مت پکارنا، ورنہ تم کو عذاب دیا جائے گا",
        "اور اپنے قریب کے رشتہ داروں کو ڈر سنا دو",
        "اور جو مومن تمہارے پیرو ہوگئے ہیں ان سے متواضع پیش آؤ",
        "پھر اگر لوگ تمہاری نافرمانی کریں تو کہہ دو کہ میں تمہارے اعمال سے بےتعلق ہوں",
        "اور (خدائے) غالب اور مہربان پر بھروسا رکھو",
        "جو تم کو جب تم (تہجد) کے وقت اُٹھتے ہو دیکھتا ہے",
        "اور نمازیوں میں تمہارے پھرنے کو بھی",
        "بےشک وہ سننے اور جاننے والا ہے",
        "(اچھا) میں تمیں بتاؤں کہ شیطان کس پر اُترتے ہیں",
        "ہر جھوٹے گنہگار پر اُترتے ہیں",
        "جو سنی ہوئی بات (اس کے کام میں) لا ڈالتے ہیں اور وہ اکثر جھوٹے ہیں",
        "اور شاعروں کی پیروی گمراہ لوگ کیا کرتے ہیں",
        "کیا تم نے نہیں دیکھا کہ وہ ہر وادی میں سر مارتے پھرتے ہیں",
        "اور کہتے وہ ہیں جو کرتے نہیں",
        "مگر جو لوگ ایمان لائے اور نیک کام کئے اور خدا کو بہت یاد کرتے رہے اور اپنے اوپر ظلم ہونے کے بعد انتقام لیا اور ظالم عنقریب جان لیں گے کہ کون سی جگہ لوٹ کر جاتے ہیں"
