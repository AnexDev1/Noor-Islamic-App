        "˹This is˺ a discharge from all obligations, by Allah and His Messenger, to the polytheists you ˹believers˺ have entered into treaties with:",
        "“You ˹polytheists˺ may travel freely through the land for four months, but know that you will have no escape from Allah, and that Allah will disgrace the disbelievers.”",
        "A declaration from Allah and His Messenger ˹is made˺ to all people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah and His Messenger are free of the polytheists. So if you ˹pagans˺ repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, then know that you will have no escape from Allah. And give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the disbelievers of a painful punishment.",
        "As for the polytheists who have honoured every term of their treaty with you and have not supported an enemy against you, honour your treaty with them until the end of its term. Surely Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "But once the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists ˹who violated their treaties˺ wherever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them on every way. But if they repent, perform prayers, and pay alms-tax, then set them free. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "And if anyone from the polytheists asks for your protection ˹O Prophet˺, grant it to them so they may hear the Word of Allah, then escort them to a place of safety, for they are a people who have no knowledge.",
        "How can such polytheists have a treaty with Allah and His Messenger, except those you have made a treaty with at the Sacred Mosque? So, as long as they are true to you, be true to them. Indeed Allah loves those who are mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "How ˹can they have a treaty˺? If they were to have the upper hand over you, they would have no respect for kinship or treaty. They only flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are in denial, and most of them are rebellious.",
        "They chose a fleeting gain over Allah’s revelations, hindering ˹others˺ from His Way. Evil indeed is what they have done!",
        "They do not honour the bonds of kinship or treaties with the believers. It is they who are the transgressors.",
        "But if they repent, perform prayer, and pay alms-tax, then they are your brothers in faith. This is how We make the revelations clear for people of knowledge.",
        "But if they break their oaths after making a pledge and attack your faith, then fight the champions of disbelief—who never honour their oaths—so perhaps they will desist.",
        "Will you not fight those who have broken their oaths, conspired to expel the Messenger ˹from Mecca˺, and attacked you first? Do you fear them? Allah is more deserving of your fear, if you are ˹true˺ believers.",
        "˹So˺ fight them and Allah will punish them at your hands, put them to shame, help you overcome them, and soothe the hearts of the believers—",
        "removing rage from their hearts. And Allah pardons whoever He wills. For Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
        "Do you ˹believers˺ think that you will be left without Allah proving who among you ˹truly˺ struggles ˹in His cause˺ and never takes trusted allies other than Allah, His Messenger, or the believers? And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",
        "It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while they openly profess disbelief. Their deeds are void, and they will be in the Fire forever.",
        "The mosques of Allah should only be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and fear none but Allah. It is right to hope that they will be among the ˹truly˺ guided.",
        "Do you ˹pagans˺ consider providing the pilgrims with water and maintaining the Sacred Mosque as equal to believing in Allah and the Last Day and struggling in the cause of Allah? They are not equal in Allah’s sight. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
        "Those who have believed, emigrated, and strived in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of Allah. It is they who will triumph.",
        "Their Lord gives them good news of His mercy, pleasure, and Gardens with everlasting bliss",
        "to stay there for ever and ever. Surely with Allah is a great reward.",
        "O believers! Do not take your parents and siblings as trusted allies if they choose disbelief over belief. And whoever of you does so, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If your parents and children and siblings and spouses and extended family and the wealth you have acquired and the trade you fear will decline and the homes you cherish—˹if all these˺ are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and struggling in His Way, then wait until Allah brings about His Will. Allah does not guide the rebellious people.”",
        "Indeed Allah has given you ˹believers˺ victory on many battlefields, even at the Battle of Ḥunain when you took pride in your great numbers, but they proved of no advantage to you. The earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on you, then you turned back in retreat.",
        "Then Allah sent down His reassurance upon His Messenger and the believers, and sent down forces you could not see, and punished those who disbelieved. Such was the reward of the disbelievers.",
        "Then afterwards Allah will turn in grace to whoever He wills. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "O believers! Indeed, the polytheists are ˹spiritually˺ impure, so they should not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year. If you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you out of His bounty, if He wills. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
        "Fight those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, nor comply with what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor embrace the religion of truth from among those who were given the Scripture, until they pay the tax, willingly submitting, fully humbled.",
        "The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” while the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” Such are their baseless assertions, only parroting the words of earlier disbelievers. May Allah condemn them! How can they be deluded ˹from the truth˺?",
        "They have taken their rabbis and monks as well as the Messiah, son of Mary, as lords besides Allah, even though they were commanded to worship none but One God. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. Glorified is He above what they associate ˹with Him˺!",
        "They wish to extinguish Allah’s light with their mouths, but Allah will only allow His light to be perfected, even to the dismay of the disbelievers.",
        "He is the One Who has sent His Messenger with ˹true˺ guidance and the religion of truth, making it prevail over all others, even to the dismay of the polytheists.",
        "O believers! Indeed, many rabbis and monks consume people’s wealth wrongfully and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah. Give good news of a painful torment to those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah’s cause.",
        "The Day ˹will come˺ when their treasure will be heated up in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads, sides, and backs branded with it. ˹It will be said to them,˺ “This is the treasure you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste what you hoarded!”",
        "Indeed, the number of months ordained by Allah is twelve—in Allah’s Record since the day He created the heavens and the earth—of which four are sacred. That is the Right Way. So do not wrong one another during these months. And together fight the polytheists as they fight against you together. And know that Allah is with those mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "Reallocating the sanctity of ˹these˺ months is an increase in disbelief, by which the disbelievers are led ˹far˺ astray. They adjust the sanctity one year and uphold it in another, only to maintain the number of months sanctified by Allah, violating the very months Allah has made sacred. Their evil deeds have been made appealing to them. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.",
        "O believers! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the cause of Allah, you cling firmly to ˹your˺ land? Do you prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this worldly life is insignificant compared to that of the Hereafter.",
        "If you do not march forth, He will afflict you with a painful torment and replace you with other people. You are not harming Him in the least. And Allah is Most Capable of everything.",
        "˹It does not matter˺ if you ˹believers˺ do not support him, for Allah did in fact support him when the disbelievers drove him out ˹of Mecca˺ and he was only one of two. While they both were in the cave, he reassured his companion, “Do not worry; Allah is certainly with us.” So Allah sent down His serenity upon the Prophet, supported him with forces you ˹believers˺ did not see, and made the word of the disbelievers lowest, while the Word of Allah is supreme. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
        "˹O believers!˺ March forth whether it is easy or difficult for you, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the cause of Allah. That is best for you, if only you knew.",
        "Had the gain been within reach and the journey shorter, they would have followed you, but the distance seemed too long for them. And they will swear by Allah, “Had we been able, we would have certainly joined you.” They are ruining themselves. And Allah knows that they are surely lying.",
        "May Allah pardon you ˹O Prophet˺! Why did you give them permission ˹to stay behind˺ before those who told the truth were distinguished from those who were lying?",
        "Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask for exemption from striving with their wealth and their lives. And Allah has perfect knowledge of those who are mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "No one would ask for exemption except those who have no faith in Allah or the Last Day, and whose hearts are in doubt, so they are torn by their doubts.",
        "Had they ˹really˺ intended to march forth, they would have made preparations for it. But Allah disliked that they should go, so He let them lag behind, and it was said ˹to them˺, “Stay with those ˹helpless˺ who remain behind.”",
        "Had they gone forth with you ˹believers˺, they would have been nothing but trouble for you, and would have scrambled around, seeking to spread discord in your midst. And some of you would have eagerly listened to them. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers.",
        "They had already sought to spread discord before and devised every ˹possible˺ plot against you ˹O Prophet˺, until the truth came and Allah’s Will prevailed—much to their dismay.",
        "There are some of them who say, “Exempt me and do not expose me to temptation.” They have already fallen into temptation. And Hell will surely engulf the disbelievers.",
        "If a blessing befalls you ˹O Prophet˺, they grieve, but if a disaster befalls you, they say, “We took our precaution in advance,” and turn away, rejoicing.",
        "Say, “Nothing will ever befall us except what Allah has destined for us. He is our Protector.” So in Allah let the believers put their trust.",
        "Say, “Are you awaiting anything to befall us except one of the two best things: ˹victory or martyrdom˺? But We are awaiting Allah to afflict you with torment either from Him or at our hands. So keep waiting! We too are waiting with you.”",
        "Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Whether you˺ donate willingly or unwillingly, it will never be accepted from you, for you have been a rebellious people.”",
        "And what prevented their donations from being accepted is that they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger, they never come to prayer except half-heartedly, and they never donate except resentfully.",
        "So let neither their wealth nor children impress you ˹O Prophet˺. Allah only intends to torment them through these things in this worldly life, then their souls will depart while they are disbelievers.",
        "They swear by Allah that they are part of you, but they are not. They only say so out of fear.",
        "If only they could find a refuge, or a cave, or any hiding-place, they would rush headlong towards it.",
        "There are some of them who are critical of your distribution of alms ˹O Prophet˺. If they are given some of it they are pleased, but if not they are enraged.",
        "If only they had been content with what Allah and His Messenger had given them and said, “Allah is sufficient for us! Allah will grant us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger. To Allah ˹alone˺ we turn with hope.”",
        "Alms-tax is only for the poor and the needy, for those employed to administer it, for those whose hearts are attracted ˹to the faith˺, for ˹freeing˺ slaves, for those in debt, for Allah’s cause, and for ˹needy˺ travellers. ˹This is˺ an obligation from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
        "And there are others who hurt the Prophet by saying, “He listens to anyone.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He listens to what is best for you. He believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a mercy for those who believe among you.” Those who hurt Allah’s Messenger will suffer a painful punishment.",
        "They swear by Allah to you ˹believers˺ in order to please you, while it is the pleasure of Allah and His Messenger they should seek, if they are ˹true˺ believers.",
        "Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger will be in the Fire of Hell forever? That is the ultimate disgrace.",
        "The hypocrites fear that a sûrah should be revealed about them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Keep mocking! Allah will definitely bring to light what you fear.”",
        "If you question them, they will certainly say, “We were only talking idly and joking around.” Say, “Was it Allah, His revelations, and His Messenger that you ridiculed?”",
        "Make no excuses! You have lost faith after your belief. If We pardon a group of you, We will punish others for their wickedness.",
        "The hypocrites, both men and women, are all alike: they encourage what is evil, forbid what is good, and withhold ˹what is in˺ their hands. They neglected Allah, so He neglected them. Surely the hypocrites are the rebellious.",
        "Allah has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers an everlasting stay in the Fire of Hell—it is sufficient for them. Allah has condemned them, and they will suffer a never-ending punishment.",
        "˹You hypocrites are˺ like those ˹disbelievers˺ before you. They were far superior to you in might and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share in this life. You have enjoyed your share, just as they did. And you have engaged in idle talk, just as they did. Their deeds have become void in this world and the Hereafter. And it is they who are the ˹true˺ losers.",
        "Have they not received the stories of those ˹destroyed˺ before them: the people of Noah, ’Âd, and Thamûd, the people of Abraham, the residents of Midian, and the overturned cities ˹of Lot˺? Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. Allah would have never wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves.",
        "The believers, both men and women, are guardians of one another. They encourage good and forbid evil, establish prayer and pay alms-tax, and obey Allah and His Messenger. It is they who will be shown Allah’s mercy. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.",
        "Allah has promised the believers, both men and women, Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever, and splendid homes in the Gardens of Eternity, and—above all—the pleasure of Allah. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.",
        "O Prophet! Struggle against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm with them. Hell will be their home. What an evil destination!",
        "They swear by Allah that they never said anything ˹blasphemous˺, while they did in fact utter a blasphemy, lost faith after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not carry out. It is only through resentment that they pay Allah and His Messenger back for enriching them out of His bounty! If they repent, it will be better for them. But if they turn away, Allah will torment them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no one on earth to protect or help them.",
        "And there are some who had made a vow to Allah: “If He gives us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity and be of the righteous.”",
        "But when He gave them out of His bounty, they withheld it and turned away indifferently.",
        "So He caused hypocrisy to plague their hearts until the Day they will meet Him, for breaking their promise to Allah and for their lies.",
        "Do they not know that Allah ˹fully˺ knows their ˹evil˺ thoughts and secret talks, and that Allah is the Knower of all unseen?",
        "˹There are˺ those who slander ˹some of˺ the believers for donating liberally and mock others for giving only the little they can afford. Allah will throw their mockery back at them, and they will suffer a painful punishment.",
        "˹It does not matter˺ whether you ˹O Prophet˺ pray for them to be forgiven or not. Even if you pray for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will never forgive them. That is because they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger. And Allah does not guide the rebellious people.",
        "Those ˹hypocrites˺ who remained behind rejoiced for doing so in defiance of the Messenger of Allah and hated ˹the prospect of˺ striving with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah. They said ˹to one another˺, “Do not march forth in the heat.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The Fire of Hell is far hotter!” If only they could comprehend!",
        "So let them laugh a little—they will weep much as a reward for what they have committed.",
        "If Allah returns you ˹O Prophet˺ to a group of them and they ask to go forth with you, say, “You will not ever go forth or fight an enemy along with me. You preferred to stay behind the first time, so stay with those ˹helpless˺ who remain behind.”",
        "And do not ever offer ˹funeral˺ prayers for any of their dead, nor stand by their grave ˹at burial˺, for they have lost faith in Allah and His Messenger and died rebellious.",
        "And let neither their wealth nor children impress you ˹O Prophet˺. Allah only intends to torment them through these things in this world, and ˹then˺ their souls will depart while they are disbelievers.",
        "Whenever a sûrah is revealed stating, “Believe in Allah and struggle along with His Messenger,” the rich among them would ask to be exempt, saying, “Leave us with those who remain behind.”",
        "They preferred to stay behind with the helpless, and their hearts have been sealed so they do not comprehend.",
        "But the Messenger and the believers with him strived with their wealth and their lives. They will have all the best, and it is they who will be successful.",
        "Allah has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. That is the ultimate triumph.",
        "Some nomadic Arabs ˹also˺ came with excuses, seeking exemption. And those who were untrue to Allah and His Messenger remained behind ˹with no excuse˺. The unfaithful among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment.",
        "There is no blame on the weak, the sick, or those lacking the means ˹if they stay behind˺, as long as they are true to Allah and His Messenger. There is no blame on the good-doers. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "Nor ˹is there any blame on˺ those who came to you ˹O Prophet˺ for mounts, then when you said, “I can find no mounts for you,” they left with eyes overflowing with tears out of grief that they had nothing to contribute.",
        "Blame is only on those who seek exemption from you although they have the means. They preferred to stay behind with the helpless, and Allah has sealed their hearts so they do not realize ˹the consequences˺.",
        "They will make excuses to you ˹believers˺ when you return to them. Say, “Make no excuses, ˹for˺ we will not believe you. Allah has already informed us about your ˹true˺ state ˹of faith˺. Your ˹future˺ deeds will be observed by Allah and His Messenger as well. And you will be returned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, then He will inform you of what you used to do.”",
        "When you return, they will swear to you by Allah so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone—they are truly evil. Hell will be their home as a reward for what they have committed.",
        "They will swear to you in order to please you. And even if you are pleased with them, Allah will never be pleased with the rebellious people.",
        "The nomadic Arabs ˹around Medina˺ are far worse in disbelief and hypocrisy, and less likely to know the laws revealed by Allah to His Messenger. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
        "And among the nomads are those who consider what they donate to be a loss and await your misfortune. May ill-fortune befall them! And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "However, among the nomadic Arabs are those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and consider what they donate as a means of coming closer to Allah and ˹receiving˺ the prayers of the Messenger. It will certainly bring them closer. Allah will admit them into His mercy. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "As for the foremost—the first of the Emigrants and the Helpers—and those who follow them in goodness, Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. And He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. That is the ultimate triumph.",
        "Some of the nomads around you ˹believers˺ are hypocrites, as are some of the people of Medina. They have mastered hypocrisy. They are not known to you ˹O Prophet˺; they are known to Us. We will punish them twice ˹in this world˺, then they will be brought back ˹to their Lord˺ for a tremendous punishment.",
        "Some others have confessed their wrongdoing: they have mixed goodness with evil. It is right to hope that Allah will turn to them in mercy. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.",
        "Take from their wealth ˹O Prophet˺ charity to purify and bless them, and pray for them—surely your prayer is a source of comfort for them. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",
        "Do they not know that Allah alone accepts the repentance of His servants and receives ˹their˺ charity, and that Allah alone is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful?",
        "Tell ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Do as you will. Your deeds will be observed by Allah, His Messenger, and the believers. And you will be returned to the Knower of the seen and unseen, then He will inform you of what you used to do.”",
        "And some others are left for Allah’s decision, either to punish them or turn to them in mercy. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
        "There are also those ˹hypocrites˺ who set up a mosque ˹only˺ to cause harm, promote disbelief, divide the believers, and as a base for those who had previously fought against Allah and His Messenger. They will definitely swear, “We intended nothing but good,” but Allah bears witness that they are surely liars.",
        "Do not ˹O Prophet˺ ever pray in it. Certainly, a mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy of your prayers. In it are men who love to be purified. And Allah loves those who purify themselves.",
        "Which is better: those who laid the foundation of their building on the fear and pleasure of Allah, or those who did so on the edge of a crumbling cliff that tumbled down with them into the Fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.",
        "The building which they erected will never cease to fuel hypocrisy in their hearts until their hearts are torn apart. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.",
        "Allah has indeed purchased from the believers their lives and wealth in exchange for Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah and kill or are killed. This is a true promise binding on Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Quran. And whose promise is truer than Allah’s? So rejoice in the exchange you have made with Him. That is ˹truly˺ the ultimate triumph.",
        "˹It is the believers˺ who repent, who are devoted to worship, who praise ˹their Lord˺, who fast, who bow down and prostrate themselves, who encourage good and forbid evil, and who observe the limits set by Allah. And give good news to the believers.",
        "It is not ˹proper˺ for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were close relatives, after it has become clear to the believers that they are bound for the Hellfire.",
        "As for Abraham’s prayer for his father’s forgiveness, it was only in fulfilment of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to Abraham that his father was an enemy of Allah, he broke ties with him. Abraham was truly tender-hearted, forbearing.",
        "Allah would never consider a people deviant after He has guided them, until He makes clear to them what they must avoid. Surely Allah has ˹full˺ knowledge of everything.",
        "Indeed, to Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death. And besides Allah you have no guardian or helper.",
        "Allah has certainly turned in mercy to the Prophet as well as the Emigrants and the Helpers who stood by him in the time of hardship, after the hearts of a group of them had almost faltered. He then accepted their repentance. Surely He is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to them.",
        "And ˹Allah has also turned in mercy to˺ the three who had remained behind, ˹whose guilt distressed them˺ until the earth, despite its vastness, seemed to close in on them, and their souls were torn in anguish. They knew there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy so that they might repent. Surely Allah ˹alone˺ is the Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful.",
        "O  believers! Be mindful of Allah and be with the truthful.",
        "It was not ˹proper˺ for the people of Medina and the nomadic Arabs around them to avoid marching with the Messenger of Allah or to prefer their own lives above his. That is because whenever they suffer from thirst, fatigue, or hunger in the cause of Allah; or tread on a territory, unnerving the disbelievers; or inflict any loss on an enemy—it is written to their credit as a good deed. Surely Allah never discounts the reward of the good-doers.",
        "And whenever they make a donation, small or large, or cross a valley ˹in Allah’s cause˺—it is written to their credit, so that Allah may grant them the best reward for what they used to do.",
        "˹However,˺ it is not necessary for the believers to march forth all at once. Only a party from each group should march forth, leaving the rest to gain religious knowledge then enlighten their people when they return to them, so that they ˹too˺ may beware ˹of evil˺.",
        "O believers! Fight the disbelievers around you and let them find firmness in you. And know that Allah is with those mindful ˹of Him˺.",
        "Whenever a sûrah is revealed, some of them ask ˹mockingly˺, “Which of you has this increased in faith?” As for the believers, it has increased them in faith and they rejoice.",
        "But as for those with sickness in their hearts, it has increased them only in wickedness upon their wickedness, and they die as disbelievers.",
        "Do they not see that they are tried once or twice every year? Yet they neither repent nor do they learn a lesson.",

        "There certainly has come to you a messenger from among yourselves. He is concerned by your suffering, anxious for your well-being, and gracious and merciful to the believers.",
        "But if they turn away, then say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah is sufficient for me. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. In Him I put my trust. And He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”"

        "নিশ্চয় কোন মাসকে পিছিয়ে দেয়া কুফরী বৃদ্ধি করে, এর দ্বারা কাফিররা পথভ্রষ্ট হয়, তারা এটি এক বছর হালাল করে এবং আরেক বছর হারাম করে, যাতে তারা আল্লাহ যা হারাম করেছেন তার সংখ্যা ঠিক রাখে। ফলে আল্লাহ যা হারাম করেছেন, তা তারা হালাল করে। তাদের মন্দ আমলসমূহ তাদের জন্য সুশোভিত করা হয়েছে। আর আল্লাহ কাফির কওমকে হিদায়াত দেন না।",
        "হে ঈমানদারগণ, তোমাদের কী হল, যখন তোমাদের বলা হয়, আল্লাহর রাস্তায় (যুদ্ধে) বের হও, তখন তোমরা যমীনের প্রতি প্রবলভাবে ঝুঁকে পড়? তবে কি তোমরা আখিরাতের পরিবর্তে দুনিয়ার জীবনে সন্তুষ্ট হলে? অথচ দুনিয়ার জীবনের ভোগ-সামগ্রী আখিরাতের তুলনায় একেবারেই নগণ্য।",
        "যদি তোমরা (যুদ্ধে) বের না হও, তিনি তোমাদের বেদনাদায়ক আযাব দেবেন এবং তোমাদের পরিবর্তে অন্য এক কওমকে আনয়ন করবেন, আর তোমরা তাঁর কিছুমাত্র ক্ষতি করতে পারবে না। আর আল্লাহ সব কিছুর উপর ক্ষমতাবান।",

        "جس دن وہ مال دوزخ کی آگ میں (خوب) گرم کیا جائے گا۔ پھر اس سے ان (بخیلوں) کی پیشانیاں اور پہلو اور پیٹھیں داغی جائیں گی (اور کہا جائے گا) کہ یہ وہی ہے جو تم نے اپنے لیے جمع کیا تھا سو جو تم جمع کرتے تھے (اب) اس کا مزہ چکھو",
        "خدا کے نزدیک مہینے گنتی میں (بارہ ہیں یعنی) اس روز (سے) کہ اس نے آسمانوں اور زمین کو پیدا کیا۔ کتاب خدا میں (برس کے) بارہ مہینے (لکھے ہوئے) ہیں۔ ان میں سے چار مہینے ادب کے ہیں۔ یہی دین (کا) سیدھا راستہ ہے۔ تو ان (مہینوں) میں (قتال ناحق سے) اپنے آپ پر ظلم نہ کرنا۔ اور تم سب کے سب مشرکوں سے لڑو جیسے وہ سب کے سب تم سے لڑتے ہیں۔ اور جان رکھو کہ خدا پرہیز گاروں کے ساتھ ہے",
        "امن کے کس مہینے کو ہٹا کر آگے پیچھے کر دینا کفر میں اضافہ کرتا ہے اس سے کافر گمراہی میں پڑے رہتے ہیں۔ ایک سال تو اس کو حلال سمجھ لیتے ہیں اور دوسرے سال حرام۔ تاکہ ادب کے مہینوں کو جو خدا نے مقرر کئے ہیں گنتی پوری کر لیں۔ اور جو خدا نے منع کیا ہے اس کو جائز کر لیں۔ ان کے برے اعمال ان کے بھلے دکھائی دیتے ہیں۔ اور خدا کافر لوگوں کو ہدایت نہیں دیا کرتا",
        "مومنو! تمہیں کیا ہوا ہے کہ جب تم سے کہا جاتا ہے کہ خدا کی راہ میں (جہاد کے لیے) نکلو تو تم (کاہلی کے سبب سے) زمین پر گرے جاتے ہو (یعنی گھروں سے نکلنا نہیں چاہتے) کیا تم آخرت (کی نعمتوں) کو چھوڑ کر دینا کی زندگی پر خوش ہو بیٹھے ہو۔ دنیا کی زندگی کے فائدے تو آخرت کے مقابل بہت ہی کم ہیں",
        "اور اگر تم نہ نکلو گے تو خدا تم کو بڑی تکلیف کا عذاب دے گا۔ اور تمہاری جگہ اور لوگ پیدا کر دے گا (جو خدا کے پورے فرمانبردار ہوں گے) اور تم اس کو کچھ نقصان نہ پہنچا سکو گے اور خدا ہر چیز پر قدرت رکھتا ہے",
        "اگر تم پیغمبر کی مدد نہ کرو گے تو خدا اُن کا مددگار ہے (وہ وقت تم کو یاد ہوگا) جب ان کو کافروں نے گھر سے نکال دیا۔ (اس وقت) دو (ہی ایسے شخص تھے جن) میں (ایک ابوبکرؓ تھے) اور دوسرے (خود رسول الله) جب وہ دونوں غار (ثور) میں تھے اس وقت پیغمبر اپنے رفیق کو تسلی دیتے تھے کہ غم نہ کرو خدا ہمارے ساتھ ہے۔ تو خدا نے ان پر تسکین نازل فرمائی اور ان کو ایسے لشکروں سے مدد دی جو تم کو نظر نہیں آتے تھے اور کافروں کی بات کو پست کر دیا۔ اور بات تو خدا ہی کی بلند ہے۔ اور خدا زبردست (اور) حکمت والا ہے",
        "تم سبکبار ہو یا گراں بار (یعنی مال و اسباب تھوڑا رکھتے ہو یا بہت، گھروں سے) نکل آؤ۔ اور خدا کے رستے میں مال اور جان سے لڑو۔ یہی تمہارے حق میں اچھا ہے بشرطیکہ سمجھو",
        "اگر مالِ غنیمت سہل الحصول اور سفر بھی ہلکا سا ہوتا تو تمہارے ساتھ (شوق سے) چل دیتے۔ لیکن مسافت ان کو دور (دراز) نظر آئی (تو عذر کریں گے)۔ اور خدا کی قسمیں کھائیں گے کہ اگر ہم طاقت رکھتے تو آپ کے ساتھ ضرور نکل کھڑے ہوتے یہ (ایسے عذروں سے) اپنے تئیں ہلاک کر رہے ہیں۔ اور خدا جانتا ہے کہ جھوٹے ہیں",
        "خدا تمہیں معاف کرے۔ تم نے پیشتر اس کے کہ تم پر وہ لوگ بھی ظاہر ہو جاتے ہیں جو سچے ہیں اور وہ بھی تمہیں معلوم ہو جاتے جو جھوٹے ہیں اُن کو اجازت کیوں دی",
        "جو لوگ خدا پر اور روز آخرت پر ایمان رکھتے ہیں وہ تو تم سے اجازت نہیں مانگتے (کہ پیچھے رہ جائیں بلکہ چاہتے ہیں کہ) اپنے مال اور جان سے جہاد کریں۔ اور خدا ڈرنے والوں سے واقف ہے",
        "اجازت وہی لوگ مانگتے ہیں جو خدا پر اور پچھلے دن پر ایمان نہیں رکھتے اور ان کے دل شک میں پڑے ہوئے ہیں۔ سو وہ اپنے شک میں ڈانواں ڈول ہو رہے ہیں",
        "اور اگر وہ نکلنے کا ارادہ کرتے ہیں تو اس کے لیے سامان تیار کرتے لیکن خدا نے ان کا اُٹھنا (اور نکلنا) پسند نہ کیا تو ان کو ہلنے جلنے ہی نہ دیا اور (ان سے) کہہ دیا گیا کہ جہاں (معذور) بیٹھے ہیں تم بھی ان کے ساتھ بیٹھے رہو",
        "اگر وہ تم میں (شامل ہوکر) نکل بھی کھڑے ہوتے تو تمہارے حق میں شرارت کرتے اور تم میں فساد ڈلوانے کی غرض سے دوڑے دوڑے پھرتے اور تم میں ان کے جاسوس بھی ہیں اور خدا ظالموں کو خوب جانتا ہے",
        "یہ پہلے بھی طالب فساد رہے ہیں اور بہت سی باتوں میں تمہارے لیے الٹ پھیر کرتے رہے ہیں۔ یہاں تک کہ حق آپہنچا اور خدا کا حکم غالب ہوا اور وہ برا مانتے ہی رہ گئے",
        "اور ان میں کوئی ایسا بھی ہے جو کہتا ہے کہ مجھے تو اجازت ہی دیجئے اور آفت میں نہ ڈالئے۔ دیکھو یہ آفت میں پڑگئے ہیں اور دوزخ سب کافروں کو گھیرے ہوئے ہے",
        "(اے پیغمبر) اگر تم کو آسائش حاصل ہوتی ہے تو ان کو بری لگتی ہے۔ اور کوئی مشکل پڑتی ہے تو کہتے کہ ہم نے اپنا کام پہلے ہیں (درست) کر لیا تھا اور خوشیاں مناتے لوٹ جاتے ہیں",
        "کہہ دو کہ ہم کو کوئی مصیبت نہیں پہنچ سکتی بجز اس کے جو خدا نے ہمارے لیے لکھ دی ہو وہی ہمارا کارساز ہے۔ اور مومنوں کو خدا ہی کا بھروسہ رکھنا چاہیئے",
        "کہہ دو کہ تم ہمارے حق میں دو بھلائیوں میں سے ایک کے منتظر ہو اور ہم تمہارے حق میں اس بات کے منتظر ہیں کہ خدا (یا تو) اپنے پاس سے تم پر کوئی عذاب نازل کرے یا ہمارے ہاتھوں سے (عذاب دلوائے) تو تم بھی انتظار کرو ہم بھی تمہارے ساتھ انتظار کرتے ہیں",
        "کہہ دو کہ تم (مال) خوشی سے خرچ کرو یا ناخوشی سے تم سے ہرگز قبول نہیں کیا جائے گا تم نافرمان لوگ ہو",
        "اور ان کے خرچ (موال) کے قبول ہونے سے کوئی چیز مانع نہیں ہوئی سوا اس کے انہوں نے خدا سے اور اس کے رسول سے کفر کیا اور نماز کو آتے ہیں تو سست کاہل ہوکر اور خرچ کرتے ہیں تو ناخوشی سے",
        "تم ان کے مال اور اولاد سے تعجب نہ کرنا۔ خدا چاہتا ہے کہ ان چیزوں سے دنیا کی زندگی میں ان کو عذاب دے اور (جب) ان کی جان نکلے تو (اس وقت بھی) وہ کافر ہی ہوں",
        "اور خدا کی قسمیں کھاتے ہیں کہ وہ تم ہی میں سے ہیں حالانکہ ہو تم میں سے نہیں ہیں۔ اصل یہ ہے کہ یہ ڈرپوک لوگ ہیں",
        "اگر ان کی کوئی بچاؤ کی جگہ (جیسے قلعہ) یا غار ومغاک یا (زمین کے اندر) گھسنے کی جگہ مل جائے تو اسی طرف رسیاں تڑاتے ہوئے بھاگ جائیں",
        "اور ان میں سے بعض اسے بھی ہیں کہ (تقسیم) صدقات میں تم پر طعنہ زنی کرتے ہیں۔ اگر ان کو اس میں سے (خاطر خواہ) مل جائے تو خوش رہیں اور اگر (اس قدر) نہ ملے تو جھٹ خفا ہو جائیں",
        "اور اگر وہ اس پر خوش رہتے جو خدا اور اس کے رسول نے ان کو دیا تھا۔ اور کہتے کہ ہمیں خدا کافی ہے اور خدا اپنے فضل سے اور اس کے پیغمبر (اپنی مہربانی سے) ہمیں (پھر) دیں گے۔ اور ہمیں تو خدا ہی کی خواہش ہے (تو ان کے حق میں بہتر ہوتا)",
        "صدقات (یعنی زکوٰة وخیرات) تو مفلسوں اور محتاجوں اور کارکنان صدقات کا حق ہے اور ان لوگوں کا جن کی تالیف قلوب منظور ہے اور غلاموں کے آزاد کرانے میں اور قرضداروں (کے قرض ادا کرنے میں) اور خدا کی راہ میں اور مسافروں (کی مدد) میں (بھی یہ مال خرچ کرنا چاہیئے یہ حقوق) خدا کی طرف سے مقرر کر دیئے گئے ہیں اور خدا جاننے والا (اور) حکمت والا ہے",
        "اور ان میں بعض ایسے ہیں جو پیغمبر کو ایذا دیتے ہیں اور کہتے ہیں کہ یہ شخص نرا کان ہے۔ (ان سے) کہہ دو کہ (وہ) کان (ہے تو) تمہاری بھلائی کے لیے۔ وہ خدا کا اور مومنوں (کی بات) کا یقین رکھتا ہے اور جو لوگ تم میں سے ایمان لائے ہیں ان کے لیے رحمت ہے۔ اور جو لوگ رسول خدا کو رنج پہنچاتے ہیں ان کے لیے عذاب الیم (تیار) ہے",
        "مومنو! یہ لوگ تمہارے سامنے خدا کی قسمیں کھاتے ہیں تاکہ تم کو خوش کر دیں۔ حالانکہ اگر یہ (دل سے) مومن ہوتے تو خدا اور اس کے پیغمبر خوش کرنے کے زیادہ مستحق ہیں",
        "کیا ان لوگوں کو معلوم نہیں کہ جو شخص خدا اور اس کے رسول سے مقابلہ کرتا ہے تو اس کے لیے جہنم کی آگ (تیار) ہے جس میں وہ ہمیشہ (جلتا) رہے گا۔ یہ بڑی رسوائی ہے",
        "منافق ڈرتے رہتے ہیں کہ ان (کے پیغمبر) پر کہیں کوئی ایسی سورت (نہ) اُتر آئے کہ ان کے دل کی باتوں کو ان (مسلمانوں) پر ظاہر کر دے۔ کہہ دو کہ ہنسی کئے جاؤ۔ جس بات سے تم ڈرتے ہو خدا اس کو ضرور ظاہر کردے گا",
        "اور اگر تم ان سے (اس بارے میں) دریافت کرو تو کہیں گے ہم تو یوں ہی بات چیت اور دل لگی کرتے تھے۔ کہو کیا تم خدا اور اس کی آیتوں اور اس کے رسول سے ہنسی کرتے تھے",
        "بہانے مت بناؤ تم ایمان لانے کے بعد کافر ہو چکے ہو۔ اگر ہم تم میں سے ایک جماعت کو معاف کردیں تو دوسری جماعت کو سزا بھی دیں گے کیونکہ وہ گناہ کرتے رہے ہیں",
        "منافق مرد اور منافق عورتیں ایک دوسرے کے ہم جنس (یعنی ایک طرح کے) ہیں کہ برے کام کرنے کو کہتے اور نیک کاموں سے منع کرتے اور (خرچ کرنے سے) ہاتھ بند کئے رہتے ہیں۔ انہوں نے خدا کو بھلا دیا تو خدا نے ان کو بھلا دیا۔ بےشک منافق نافرمان ہیں",
        "الله نے منافق مردوں اور منافق عورتوں اور کافروں سے آتش جہنم کا وعدہ کیا ہے جس میں ہمیشہ (جلتے) رہیں گے۔ وہی ان کے لائق ہے۔ اور خدا نے ان پر لعنت کر دی ہے۔ اور ان کے لیے ہمیشہ کا عذاب (تیار) ہے",
        "(تم منافق لوگ) ان لوگوں کی طرح ہو، جو تم سے پہلے ہوچکے ہیں۔ وہ تم سے بہت زیادہ طاقتور اور مال و اولاد میں کہیں زیادہ تھے تو وہ اپنے حصے سے بہرہ یاب ہوچکے۔ سو جس طرح تم سے پہلے لوگ اپنے حصے سے فائدہ اٹھا چکے ہیں۔ اسی طرح تم نے اپنے حصے سے فائدہ اٹھا لیا۔ اور جس طرح وہ باطل میں ڈوبے رہے اسی طرح تم باطل میں ڈوبے رہے یہ وہ لوگ ہیں جن کے اعمال دنیا اور آخرت میں ضائع ہوگئے۔ اور یہی نقصان اٹھانے والے ہیں",
        "کیا ان کو ان لوگوں (کے حالات) کی خبر نہیں پہنچی جو ان سے پہلے تھے (یعنی) نوح اور عاد اور ثمود کی قوم۔ اور ابراہیم کی قوم اور مدین والے اور الٹی ہوئی بستیوں والے۔ ان کے پاس پیغمبر نشانیاں لے لے کر آئے۔ اور خدا تو ایسا نہ تھا کہ ان پر ظلم کرتا لیکن وہی اپنے آپ پر ظلم کرتے تھے",
        "اور مومن مرد اور مومن عورتیں ایک دوسرے کے دوست ہیں کہ اچھے کام کرنے کو کہتے ہیں اور بری باتوں سے منع کرتے اور نماز پڑھتے اور زکوٰة دیتے اور خدا اور اس کے رسول کی اطاعت کرتے ہیں۔ یہی لوگ ہیں جن پر خدا رحم کرے گا۔ بےشک خدا غالب حکمت والا ہے",
        "خدا نے مومن مردوں اور مومن عورتوں سے بہشتوں کا وعدہ کیا ہے جن کے نیچے نہریں بہہ رہی ہیں (وہ) ان میں ہمیشہ رہیں گے اور بہشت ہائے جاودانی میں نفیس مکانات کا (وعدہ کیا ہے) اور خدا کی رضا مندی تو سب سے بڑھ کر نعمت ہے یہی بڑی کامیابی ہے",
        "اے پیغمبر! کافروں اور منافقوں سے لڑو۔ اور ان پر سختی کرو۔ اور ان کا ٹھکانہ دورخ ہے اور وہ بری جگہ ہے",
        "یہ خدا کی قسمیں کھاتے ہیں کہ انہوں نے (تو کچھ) نہیں کہا حالانکہ انہوں نے کفر کا کلمہ کہا ہے اور یہ اسلام لانے کے بعد کافر ہوگئے ہیں اور ایسی بات کا قصد کرچکے ہیں جس پر قدرت نہیں پاسکے۔ اور انہوں نے (مسلمانوں میں) عیب ہی کون سا دیکھا ہے سوا اس کے کہ خدا نے اپنے فضل سے اور اس کے پیغمبر نے (اپنی مہربانی سے) ان کو دولت مند کر دیا ہے۔ تو اگر یہ لوگ توبہ کرلیں تو ان کے حق میں بہتر ہوگا۔ اور اگر منہ پھیر لیں تو ان کو دنیا اور آخرت میں دکھ دینے والا عذاب دے گا اور زمین میں ان کا کوئی دوست اور مددگار نہ ہوگا",
        "اور ان میں سے بعض ایسے ہیں جنہوں نے خدا سے عہد کیا تھا کہ اگر وہ ہم کو اپنی مہربانی سے (مال) عطا فرمائے گا تو ہم ضرور خیرات کیا کریں گے اور نیک کاروں میں ہو جائیں گے",
        "لیکن جب خدا نے ان کو اپنے فضل سے (مال) دیا تو اس میں بخل کرنے لگے اور (اپنے عہد سے) روگردانی کرکے پھر بیٹھے",
        "تو خدا نے اس کا انجام یہ کیا کہ اس روز تک کے لیے جس میں وہ خدا کے روبرو حاضر ہوں گے ان کے دلوں میں نفاق ڈال دیا اس لیے کہ انہوں نے خدا سے جو وعدہ کیا تھا اس کے خلاف کیا اور اس لیے کہ وہ جھوٹ بولتے تھے",
        "کیا ان کو معلوم نہیں کہ خدا ان کے بھیدوں اور مشوروں تک سے واقف ہے اور یہ کہ وہ غیب کی باتیں جاننے والا ہے",
        "جو (ذی استطاعت) مسلمان دل کھول کر خیرات کرتے ہیں اور جو (بےچارے غریب صرف اتنا ہی کما سکتے ہیں جتنی مزدوری کرتے (اور تھوڑی سی کمائی میں سے خرچ بھی کرتے) ہیں ان پر جو (منافق) طعن کرتے ہیں اور ہنستے ہیں۔ خدا ان پر ہنستا ہے اور ان کے لیے تکلیف دینے والا عذاب (تیار) ہے",
        "تم ان کے لیے بخشش مانگو یا نہ مانگو۔ (بات ایک ہے)۔ اگر ان کے لیے ستّر دفعہ بھی بخشش مانگو گے تو بھی خدا ان کو نہیں بخشے گا۔ یہ اس لیے کہ انہوں نے خدا اور اس کے رسول سے کفر کیا۔ اور خدا نافرمان لوگوں کو ہدایت نہیں دیتا",
        "جو لوگ (غزوہٴ تبوک میں) پیچھے رہ گئے وہ پیغمبر خدا (کی مرضی) کے خلاف بیٹھے رہنے سے خوش ہوئے اور اس بات کو ناپسند کیا کہ خدا کی راہ میں اپنے مال اور جان سے جہاد کریں۔ اور (اوروں سے بھی) کہنے لگے کہ گرمی میں مت نکلنا۔ (ان سے) کہہ دو کہ دوزخ کی آگ اس سے کہیں زیادہ گرم ہے۔ کاش یہ (اس بات) کو سمجھتے",
        "یہ (دنیا میں) تھوڑا سا ہنس لیں اور (آخرت میں) ان کو ان اعمال کے بدلے جو کرتے رہے ہیں بہت سا رونا ہوگا",
        "پھر اگر خدا تم کو ان میں سے کسی گروہ کی طرف لے جائے اور وہ تم سے نکلنے کی اجازت طلب کریں تو کہہ دینا کہ تم میرے ساتھ ہرگز نہیں نکلو گے اور نہ میرے ساتھ (مددگار ہوکر) دشمن سے لڑائی کرو گے۔ تم پہلی دفعہ بیٹھ رہنے سے خوش ہوئے تو اب بھی پیچھے رہنے والوں کے ساتھ بیٹھے رہو",
        "اور (اے پیغمبر) ان میں سے کوئی مر جائے تو کبھی اس (کے جنازے) پر نماز نہ پڑھنا اور نہ اس کی قبر پر (جا کر) کھڑے ہونا۔ یہ خدا اور اس کے رسول کے ساتھ کفر کرتے رہے اور مرے بھی نافرمان (ہی مرے)",
        "ان کے اولاد اور مال سے تعجب نہ کرنا۔ ان چیزوں سے خدا یہ چاہتا ہے کہ ان کو دنیا میں عذاب کرے اور (جب) ان کی جان نکلے تو (اس وقت بھی) یہ کافر ہی ہوں",
        "اور جب کوئی سورت نازل ہوتی ہے کہ خدا پر ایمان لاؤ اور اس کے رسول کے ساتھ ہو کر لڑائی کرو تو جو ان میں دولت مند ہیں وہ تم سے اجازت طلب کرتے ہیں اور کہتے ہیں کہ ہمیں تو رہنے ہی دیجیئے کہ جو لوگ گھروں میں رہیں گے ہم بھی ان کے ساتھ رہیں",
        "یہ اس بات سے خوش ہیں کہ عورتوں کے ساتھ جو پیچھے رہ جاتی ہیں۔ (گھروں میں بیٹھ) رہیں ان کے دلوں پر مہر لگا دی گئی ہے تو یہ سمجھتے ہی نہیں",
        "لیکن پیغمبر اور جو لوگ ان کے ساتھ ایمان لائے سب اپنے مال اور جان سے لڑے۔ انہیں لوگوں کے لیے بھلائیاں ہیں۔ اور یہی مراد پانے والے ہیں",
        "خدا نے ان کے لیے باغات تیار کر رکھے ہیں جن کے نیچے نہریں بہہ رہی ہیں ہمیشہ ان میں رہی گے۔ یہ بڑی کامیابی ہے",
        "اور صحرا نشینوں میں سے بھی کچھ لوگ عذر کرتے ہوئے (تمہارے پاس) آئے کہ ان کو بھی اجازت دی جائے اور جنہوں نے خدا اور اس کے رسول سے جھوٹ بولا وہ (گھر میں) بیٹھ رہے سو جو لوگ ان میں سے کافر ہوئے ہیں ان کو دکھ دینے والا عذاب پہنچے گا",
        "نہ تو ضعیفوں پر کچھ گناہ ہے اور نہ بیماروں پر نہ ان پر جن کے پاس خرچ موجود نہیں (کہ شریک جہاد نہ ہوں یعنی) جب کہ خدا اور اس کے رسول کے خیراندیش (اور دل سے ان کے ساتھ) ہوں۔ نیکو کاروں پر کسی طرح کا الزام نہیں ہے۔ اور خدا بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "اور نہ ان (بےسروسامان) لوگوں پر (الزام) ہے کہ تمہارے پاس آئے کہ ان کو سواری دو اور تم نے کہا کہ میرے پاس کوئی ایسی چیز نہیں جس پر تم کو سوار کروں تو وہ لوٹ گئے اور اس غم سے کہ ان کے پاس خرچ موجود نہ تھا، ان کی آنکھوں سے آنسو بہہ رہے تھے",
        "الزام تو ان لوگوں پر ہے۔ جو دولت مند ہیں اور (پھر) تم سے اجازت طلب کرتے ہیں (یعنی) اس بات سے خوش ہیں کہ عورتوں کے ساتھ جو پیچھے رہ جاتی ہیں (گھروں میں بیٹھ) رہیں۔ خدا نے ان کے دلوں پر مہر کردی ہے پس وہ سمجھتے ہی نہیں",
        "جب تم ان کے پاس واپس جاؤ گے تو تم سے عذر کریں گے تم کہنا کہ مت عذر کرو ہم ہرگز تمہاری بات نہیں مانیں گے خدا نے ہم کو تمہارے سب حالات بتا دیئے ہیں۔ اور ابھی خدا اور اس کا رسول تمہارے عملوں کو (اور) دیکھیں گے پھر تم غائب وحاضر کے جاننے والے (خدائے واحد) کی طرف لوٹائے جاؤ گے اور جو عمل تم کرتے رہے ہو وہ سب تمہیں بتائے گا",
        "جب تم ان کے پاس لوٹ کر جاؤ گے تو تمہارے روبرو خدا کی قسمیں کھائیں گے تاکہ تم ان سے درگزر کرو سو اُن کی طرف التفات نہ کرنا۔ یہ ناپاک ہیں اور جو یہ کام کرتے رہے ہیں اس کے بدلہ ان کا ٹھکانہ دوزخ ہے",
        "یہ تمہارے آگے قسمیں کھائیں گے تاکہ تم ان سے خوش ہو جاؤ لیکن اگر تم اُن سے خوش ہو جاؤ گے تو خدا تو نافرمان لوگوں سے خوش نہیں ہوتا",
        "دیہاتی لوگ سخت کافر اور سخت منافق ہیں اور اس قابل ہیں کہ جو احکام (شریعت) خدا نے اپنے رسول پر نازل فرمائے ہیں ان سے واقف (ہی) نہ ہوں۔ اور خدا جاننے والا (اور) حکمت والا ہے",
        "اور بعض دیہاتی ایسے ہیں کہ جو خرچ کرتے ہیں اسے تاوان سمجھتے ہیں اور تمہارے حق میں مصیبتوں کے منتظر ہیں۔ ان ہی پر بری مصیبت (واقع) ہو۔ اور خدا سننے والا (اور) جاننے والا ہے",
        "اور بعض دیہاتی ایسے ہیں کہ خدا پر اور روز آخرت پر ایمان رکھتے ہیں اور جو کچھ خرچ کرتے ہیں اس کو خدا کی قُربت اور پیغمبر کی دعاؤں کا ذریعہ سمجھتے ہیں۔ دیکھو وہ بےشبہ ان کے لیے (موجب) قربت ہے خدا ان کو عنقریب اپنی رحمت میں داخل کرے گا۔ بےشک خدا بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "جن لوگوں نے سبقت کی (یعنی سب سے) پہلے (ایمان لائے) مہاجرین میں سے بھی اور انصار میں سے بھی۔ اور جنہوں نے نیکو کاری کے ساتھ ان کی پیروی کی خدا ان سے خوش ہے اور وہ خدا سے خوش ہیں اور اس نے ان کے لیے باغات تیار کئے ہیں جن کے نیچے نہریں بہہ رہی ہیں اور ہمیشہ ان میں رہیں گے۔ یہ بڑی کامیابی ہے",
        "اور تمہارے گرد و نواح کے بعض دیہاتی منافق ہیں اور بعض مدینے والے بھی نفاق پر اڑے ہوئے ہیں تم انہیں نہیں جانتے۔ ہم جانتے ہیں۔ ہم ان کو دوہرا عذاب دیں گے پھر وہ بڑے عذاب کی طرف لوٹائے جائیں گے",
        "اور کچھ اور لوگ ہیں کہ اپنے گناہوں کا (صاف) اقرار کرتے ہیں انہوں نے اچھے برے عملوں کو ملا جلا دیا تھا۔ قریب ہے کہ خدا ان پر مہربانی سے توجہ فرمائے۔ بےشک خدا بخشنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "ان کے مال میں سے زکوٰة قبول کر لو کہ اس سے تم ان کو (ظاہر میں بھی) پاک اور (باطن میں بھی) پاکیزہ کرتے ہو اور ان کے حق میں دعائے خیر کرو کہ تمہاری دعا ان کے لیے موجب تسکین ہے اور خدا سننے والا اور جاننے والا ہے",
        "کیا یہ لوگ نہیں جانتے کہ خدا ہی اپنے بندوں سے توبہ قبول فرماتا ہے اور صدقات (وخیرات) لیتا ہے اور بےشک خدا ہی توبہ قبول کرنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "اور ان سے کہہ دو کہ عمل کئے جاؤ۔ خدا اور اس کا رسول اور مومن (سب) تمہارے عملوں کو دیکھ لیں گے۔ اور تم غائب وحاضر کے جاننے والے (خدائے واحد) کی طرف لوٹائے جاؤ گے پھر جو کچھ تم کرتے رہے ہو وہ سب تم کو بتا دے گا",
        "اور کچھ اور لوگ ہیں جن کا کام خدا کے حکم پر موقوف ہے۔ چاہے ان کو عذاب دے اور چاہے ان کو معاف کر دے۔ اور خدا جاننے والا اور حکمت والا ہے",
        "اور (ان میں سے ایسے بھی ہیں) جنہوں نے اس غرض سے مسجد بنوائی کہ ضرر پہنچائیں اور کفر کریں اور مومنوں میں تفرقہ ڈالیں اور جو لوگ خدا اور اس کے رسول سے پہلے جنگ کرچکے ہیں ان کے لیے گھات کی جگہ بنائیں۔ اور قسمیں کھائیں گے کہ ہمارا مقصود تو صرف بھلائی تھی۔ مگر خدا گواہی دیتا ہے کہ یہ جھوٹے ہیں",
        "تم اس (مسجد) میں کبھی (جاکر) کھڑے بھی نہ ہونا۔ البتہ وہ مسجد جس کی بنیاد پہلے دن سے تقویٰ پر رکھی گئی ہے اس قابل ہے کہ اس میں جایا (اور نماز پڑھایا) کرو۔ اس میں ایسے لوگ ہیں جو کہ پاک رہنے کو پسند کرتے ہیں۔ اور خدا پاک رہنے والوں کو ہی پسند کرتا ہے",
        "بھلا جس شخص نے اپنی عمارت کی بنیاد خدا کے خوف اور اس کی رضامندی پر رکھی وہ اچھا ہے یا وہ جس نے اپنی عمارت کی بنیاد گر جانے والی کھائی کے کنارے پر رکھی کہ وہ اس کو دوزخ کی آگ میں لے گری اور خدا ظالموں کو ہدایت نہیں دیتا",
        "یہ عمارت جو انہوں نے بنائی ہے ہمیشہ ان کے دلوں میں (موجب) خلجان رہے گی (اور ان کو متردد رکھے گی) مگر یہ کہ ان کے دل پاش پاش ہو جائیں اور خدا جاننے والا اور حکمت والا ہے",
        "خدا نے مومنوں سے ان کی جانیں اور ان کے مال خرید لیے ہیں (اور اس کے) عوض ان کے لیے بہشت (تیار کی) ہے۔ یہ لوگ خدا کی راہ میں لڑتے ہیں تو مارتے بھی ہیں اور مارے بھی جاتے ہیں بھی ہیں۔ یہ تورات اور انجیل اور قرآن میں سچا وعدہ ہے۔ جس کا پورا کرنا اسے ضرور ہے اور خدا سے زیادہ وعدہ پورا کرنے والا کون ہے تو جو سودا تم نے اس سے کیا ہے اس سے خوش رہو۔ اور یہی بڑی کامیابی ہے",
        "توبہ کرنے والے، عبادت کرنے والے، حمد کرنے والے، روزہ رکھنے والے، رکوع کرنے والے، سجدہ کرنے والے، نیک کاموں کا امر کرنے والے، بری باتوں سے منع کرنے والے، خدا کی حدوں کی حفاظت کرنے والے، (یہی مومن لوگ ہیں) اور اے پیغمبر مومنوں کو (بہشت کی) خوش خبری سنادو",
        "پیغمبر اور مسلمانوں کو شایاں نہیں کہ جب ان پر ظاہر ہوگیا کہ مشرک اہل دوزخ ہیں۔ تو ان کے لیے بخشش مانگیں گو وہ ان کے قرابت دار ہی ہوں",
        "اور ابراہیم کا اپنے باپ کے لیے بخشش مانگنا تو ایک وعدے کا سبب تھا جو وہ اس سے کر چکے تھے۔ لیکن جب ان کو معلوم ہوگیا کہ وہ خدا کا دشمن ہے تو اس سے بیزار ہوگئے۔ کچھ شک نہیں کہ ابراہیم بڑے نرم دل اور متحمل تھے",
        "اور خدا ایسا نہیں کہ کسی قوم کو ہدایت دینے کے بعد گمراہ کر دے جب تک کہ ان کو وہ چیز نہ بتا دے جس سے وہ پرہیز کریں۔ بےشک خدا ہر چیز سے واقف ہے",
        "خدا ہی ہے جس کے لیے آسمانوں اور زمینوں کی بادشاہت ہے۔ وہی زندگانی بخشتا ہے (وہی) موت دیتا ہے اور خدا کے سوا تمہارا کوئی دوست اور مددگار نہیں ہے",
        "بےشک خدا نے پیغمبر پر مہربانی کی اور مہاجرین اور انصار پر جو باوجود اس کے کہ ان میں سے بعضوں کے دل جلد پھر جانے کو تھے۔ مشکل کی گھڑی میں پیغمبر کے ساتھ رہے۔ پھر خدا نے ان پر مہربانی فرمائی۔ بےشک وہ ان پر نہایت شفقت کرنے والا (اور) مہربان ہے",
        "اور ان تینوں پر بھی جن کا معاملہ ملتوی کیا گیا تھا۔ یہاں تک کہ جب اُنہیں زمین باوجود فراخی کے ان پر تنگ ہوگئی اور ان کے جانیں بھی ان پر دوبھر ہوگئیں۔ اور انہوں نے جان لیا کہ خدا (کے ہاتھ) سے خود اس کے سوا کوئی پناہ نہیں۔ پھر خدا نے ان پر مہربانی کی تاکہ توبہ کریں۔ بےشک خدا توبہ قبول کرنے والا مہربان ہے",
        "اے اہل ایمان! خدا سے ڈرتے رہو اور راست بازوں کے ساتھ رہو",
        "اہل مدینہ کو اور جو ان کے آس پاس دیہاتی رہتے ہیں ان کو شایاں نہ تھا کہ پیغمبر خدا سے پیچھے رہ جائیں اور نہ یہ کہ اپنی جانوں کو ان کی جان سے زیادہ عزیز رکھیں۔ یہ اس لیے کہ انہیں خدا کی راہ میں تکلیف پہنچتی ہے پیاس کی، محنت کی یا بھوک کی یا وہ ایسی جگہ چلتے ہیں کہ کافروں کو غصہ آئے یا دشمنوں سے کوئی چیز لیتے ہیں تو ہر بات پر ان کے لیے عمل نیک لکھا جاتا ہے۔ کچھ شک نہیں کہ خدا نیکو کاروں کا اجر ضائع نہیں کرتا",
        "اور (اسی طرح) جو وہ خرچ کرتے ہیں تھوڑا یا بہت یا کوئی میدان طے کرتے ہیں تو یہ سب کچھ ان کے لیے (اعمال صالحہ) میں لکھ لیا جاتا ہے تاکہ خدا ان کو ان کے اعمال کا بہت اچھا بدلہ دے",
        "اور یہ تو ہو نہیں سکتا کہ مومن سب کے سب نکل آئیں۔ تو یوں کیوں نہ کیا کہ ہر ایک جماعت میں سے چند اشخاص نکل جاتے تاکہ دین کا (علم سیکھتے اور اس) میں سمجھ پیدا کرتے اور جب اپنی قوم کی طرف واپس آتے تو ان کو ڈر سناتے تاکہ وہ حذر کرتے",
        "اے اہلِ ایمان! اپنے نزدیک کے (رہنے والے) کافروں سے جنگ کرو اور چاہیئے کہ وہ تم میں سختی (یعنی محنت وقوت جنگ) معلوم کریں۔ اور جان رکھو کہ خدا پرہیز گاروں کے ساتھ ہے",
        "اور جب کوئی سورت نازل ہوتی ہے تو بعض منافق (استہزاء کرتے اور) پوچھتے کہ اس سورت نے تم میں سے کس کا ایمان زیادہ کیا ہے۔ سو جو ایمان والے ہیں ان کا ایمان تو زیادہ کیا اور وہ خوش ہوتے ہیں",
        "اور جن کے دلوں میں مرض ہے، ان کے حق میں خبث پر خبث زیادہ کیا اور وہ مرے بھی تو کافر کے کافر",
        "کیا یہ دیکھتے نہیں کہ یہ ہر سال ایک یا دو بار بلا میں پھنسا دیئے جاتے ہیں پھر بھی توبہ نہیں کرتے اور نہ نصیحت پکڑتے ہیں",
        "اور جب کوئی سورت نازل ہوتی ہے ایک دوسرے کی جانب دیکھنے لگتے ہیں (اور پوچھتے ہیں کہ) بھلا تمہیں کوئی دیکھتا ہے پھر پھر جاتے ہیں۔ خدا نے ان کے دلوں کو پھیر رکھا ہے کیونکہ یہ ایسے لوگ ہیں کہ سمجھ سے کام نہیں لیتے",
        "(لوگو) تمہارے پاس تم ہی میں سے ایک پیغمبر آئے ہیں۔ تمہاری تکلیف ان کو گراں معلوم ہوتی ہے اور تمہاری بھلائی کے خواہش مند ہیں اور مومنوں پر نہایت شفقت کرنے والے (اور) مہربان ہیں",
        "پھر اگر یہ لوگ پھر جائیں (اور نہ مانیں) تو کہہ دو کہ خدا مجھے کفایت کرتا ہے اس کے سوا کوئی معبود نہیں اسی پر میرا بھروسہ ہے اور وہی عرش عظیم کا مالک ہے"
